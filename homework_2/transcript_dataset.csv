8d2005ec35280deb6a438dc87b225f89,00:04,"Humankind loves to build walls. Have you ever noticed that? We build walls for everything: for shelter, for protection, for privacy. Over the past 70 years, the number of barriers between countries has doubled. Right now, there are more walls than at the end of the Second World War, more than during the Cold War. "
8d2005ec35280deb6a438dc87b225f89,00:30,"Growing up in Germany, the fall of the Berlin Wall always felt to me like the introduction of a new world, a world without barriers. But since the attacks of 9/11, the construction has experienced an extreme rise. Since then, the amount has doubled, with about 30 new structures that were planned or built. Walls and fences are often built with the intention of security, security from another group of people, from crime, from illegal trades. But walls and fences only provide us with a feeling of security, which is different from real security. Even though they might make us feel safe, the structures themselves can't protect us. "
8d2005ec35280deb6a438dc87b225f89,01:13,"Instead, they do something else: they separate. They create an us and a them. They establish an enemy. Walls make us build a second wall in our head, a mental wall. And those mental walls slowly make us lose sight of all the things we have in common with the people on the other side. The other way around, mental walls can grow so strong that they encourage us to build, keep or strengthen physical walls. "
8d2005ec35280deb6a438dc87b225f89,01:44,"Physical and mental walls are closely interlinked, and one almost always comes with the other. It's a constant cycle: physical walls empower mental walls, and mental walls empower physical walls until at one point one part falls away, and the cycle is disrupted. "
8d2005ec35280deb6a438dc87b225f89,02:01,"When the Berlin Wall was being built, it was hard to tell who the wall was facing, because the people living around it identified as one. There was no us and them. There was no others. During the time of separation, both sides developed differently and formed individual identities. All of a sudden, there was an us and a them. A mental wall was built, and when the Berlin Wall fell again in 1989, this mental wall in the head of the people stayed. Eastern Germans had to be reintegrated into their own country, and even though they didn't have to move places, many still today feel like they have never fully arrived. Those remaining effects of the mental wall are also measurable. "
8d2005ec35280deb6a438dc87b225f89,02:47,"A study from the Freie University of Berlin in 2005 shows that even 15 years after the reunification, Germans still believed that cities on the other side of the former wall are further away than they really are. The interesting thing is that they found a link between political attitude and estimation of the distance. The more a participant was against the German reunification, the further away they estimated cities to be. It's the mental wall which keeps cities on the other side far away, and the higher and stronger this mental wall, the more difficult they seem to be reached. "
8d2005ec35280deb6a438dc87b225f89,03:30,"I tried to repeat this study with a group of young Germans who grew up without the wall to see if these effects are still measurable nowadays. And the results show that this generation, my generation, is just kind of bad at geography in general -- "
8d2005ec35280deb6a438dc87b225f89,03:47,"East and West. But in our defense, this could be seen as an improvement, right? We never experienced the actual wall. This physical barrier was never able to make us build a mental wall in the first place. "
8d2005ec35280deb6a438dc87b225f89,04:01,"I would love to take this as a serious indication that there could be a future without a mental wall dividing Germany, but I think we have to face reality: this one wall could be disappearing, but in the meanwhile, a billion others are constructed. One global trend we are currently experiencing is the rise of gated communities. And in a way, gated communities can be seen the same exact way as countries, just on the small scale -- neighborhoods surrounded by walls and fences to protect citizens from other citizens -- and the only difference is, it's by choice. But the physical and mental effects on the people living inside and the people kept outside are the same, separating cities, neighborhoods and even playgrounds. "
8d2005ec35280deb6a438dc87b225f89,04:51,"In the spring of last year, I worked on a design project in Brussels at two elementary schools where this was the case. Both the schools share an entrance and the schoolyard. Both schools teach in Dutch. But one school is mainly visited by Belgian children, and the other school, by immigrant children. The schools are separated by walls and fences, leaving the children no point of interaction other than this fence on the schoolyard that separates them. When I started to work there, it made me sad to see children having to stand at a fence to talk to their friend on the other side. But what's even worse is that most of the children will never get the opportunity to even make a friend on the other side. "
8d2005ec35280deb6a438dc87b225f89,05:35,"School should be the place where children, all children, come together and learn -- learn from the teacher, but more importantly, learn from each other. And the more diversity, the more there is to learn. In fact, school might be the only time in our lives where establishing a contact despite social differences is even possible. Separating children during this time of their development will make integration extremely difficult, if not impossible. "
8d2005ec35280deb6a438dc87b225f89,06:05,"And yet, somehow, I seem to be the only one having a problem with this fence in Brussels. Most of the parents, teachers and children stopped seeing or at least questioning the structure. It's just how it is. Nobody has ever seen it differently. And people are in favor of it. I once asked a boy if he would like to play with the other side, and he said, ""No."" Then I asked if he would play with them if the fence wasn't there, and he said, ""Probably."" But then he quickly added that the fence should stay, because the other side is mean and they never give back his ball. It's funny, because I talked to children from both sides, and everyone told me that the other side is mean because they never give back the ball. The children on both sides dislike each other, and there are regularly arguments breaking out at this fence, which is also the main reason why people feel the need for it to be there: it protects the children from each other, or at least their toys, and it prevents chaos. At some point, the children started to crawl beneath the fence to get their ball back, and the reaction of the schools was to put these metal plates there. Now they climb over. "
8d2005ec35280deb6a438dc87b225f89,07:16,"I don't know what came first in Brussels: a mental wall that grew too strong that it made them build a physical fence, or this fence that now emphasizes the social differences, even on the schoolyard. But what I did know when I started to work there was that I wanted to change something about the situation. I wanted to show both sides again how much they have in common. For children, this isn't very hard, because even though one schoolyard speaks Dutch and the other schoolyard, a mix of French, Turkish and Arabic, they all speak the universal language of play. And it turned out the desire to play is a lot stronger than all the supposed differences between them. I installed different games at the fence, which turned it into an interface, a common ground, instead of a barrier. And all of a sudden, children were drawing together, exchanging pencils and talking on the phone. Especially the phones were a great success, because they were so amazed by the fact that they can hear the other side through this device that they couldn't stop speaking. "
8d2005ec35280deb6a438dc87b225f89,08:20,"In the case of an elementary school, parents play a very big role in shaping the everyday life and the environment of their children. So I knew that if I wanted to make a difference, I had to somehow show them, too, how much they have in common with the other side. But for parents, this was a lot more difficult, because most of them speak different languages, work different jobs with different incomes, live in different social circles, believe in different religions, experience different cultures and share different values. And then there was me, a student, different in all of these aspects again. So how could I show them how much they have in common? "
8d2005ec35280deb6a438dc87b225f89,08:57,"I chose not to convince them myself but by letting their own children do the talking. I designed a picture exhibition on the schoolyard showing them their children playing together through the fence. At the end of this exhibition, I asked people to write down their thoughts, ideas and wishes on these big wooden boxes, and I labeled the boxes with, ""What do you think?"" A lot of people wrote ""Yes"" on it. Yes, what? I never mentioned my opinion or an action that should follow, so which question were they answering with yes? When I asked, they said yes, the fence should go. Yes, we want to play with the other side. The pictures implied enough to answer a question that was never proposed. People were seeing the absurdity of the situation again and felt how unnecessary this fence is without me forcing an opinion on them. The exhibition showed the two sides their similarities for once. That day, there was no us and them, there was no others. The mental wall started to crumble. "
8d2005ec35280deb6a438dc87b225f89,10:04,"I chose the word ""crumbling,"" because breaking a mental wall is a long journey, and breaking a mental wall can be a lot more difficult than simply tearing down the physical one. We have to challenge our opinion and beliefs and maybe even admit our own wrongs. So what happened in Brussels was a big step, a step that has been taking generations in Germany. "
8d2005ec35280deb6a438dc87b225f89,10:30,"There are many examples from all over the world telling the same story I experienced in Brussels and Germany, enough examples from which we could have learned. But still, we seek walls as solutions for problems that they cannot solve, because walls don't fight the root of our problem. If anything, they reduce the symptoms. "
8d2005ec35280deb6a438dc87b225f89,10:53,"So the next time you are planning to build a wall or you are planning to support someone who wants to build a wall, I want you to remember the impact you are really having. Because, this simple structure will hardly create more security. Instead, it will affect the people living with it every day, people who, despite the geographic border, often share a lot of culture and values. For them, you are not building one wall but two, two walls which will take decades and generations to overcome again. "
8d2005ec35280deb6a438dc87b225f89,11:32,Thank you. 
b3072cd11f40eb57fd259555264476c6,00:04,"Chris Anderson: Well, hello, Helen. Very nice to see you. "
b3072cd11f40eb57fd259555264476c6,00:06,CA: You staying well? Helen Walters: How's it going? 
b3072cd11f40eb57fd259555264476c6,00:09,"CA: These are mad, mad, mad, mad, mad days. So many emotions. Not all bad, happily, but I'm just so aware that, among the people listening to this, some are in really tough times right now. I hope this is going to be a beautiful hour of therapy and help in its own way, because we have with us just an extraordinary author, an extraordinary mind, Elizabeth Gilbert, obviously known for her astonishing best-selling success with ""Eat, Pray, Love,"" although her favorite book from my point of view is called ""Big Magic,"" where the subtitle is, ""Creative Living Beyond Fear."" ""Creative Living Beyond Fear."" Now when you think about it, that is a pretty good agenda for today's conversation, I think. Liz describes the emotional landscape of our lives, I think like no one else I've read, and I'm not even her target audience. She's really extraordinary in doing that. She gave an amazing TED Talk 11 years ago now, ""In pursuit of your creative genius."" It really reframed how to think of creativity. It's been seen, like, 19 million times or something, and it's really changed how a lot of people -- they're just open to the creative genius coming from the outside. So it's a delight to welcome to the TED Connects stage Elizabeth Gilbert. "
b3072cd11f40eb57fd259555264476c6,01:46,"Elizabeth Gilbert: Hey, Chris. "
b3072cd11f40eb57fd259555264476c6,01:48,CA: Great to see you. How are you? Where are you? Who are you living with or staying with? What's up? 
b3072cd11f40eb57fd259555264476c6,01:56,"EG: I'm fine. I don't want to brag, but I'm in New Jersey, where anybody would want to be. I'm by myself. I've got a little house out in the country, and I think I'm on day 17 of no human contact other than virtually, and I'm well. I'm not anybody you need to be worrying about right now. So I'm good. "
b3072cd11f40eb57fd259555264476c6,02:21,"CA: Wow. Well, so in a way, you're having a related experience to what so many people are having. I mean, these are days of isolation for many people, and that brings with it lots of difficult emotions, in a way. And we're going to go through many of them, I hope, in the next hour. So I'm hoping to talk with you about -- I wrote down a list here: about anxiety, loneliness, curiosity, creativity, procrastination, grief, connection and hope. How about that? That's our agenda. Are you up for that? "
b3072cd11f40eb57fd259555264476c6,02:54,EG: I think that's the whole buffet. 
b3072cd11f40eb57fd259555264476c6,02:57,Just a little light tasting menu of all the mass of human emotions. Let's do it. Absolutely. 
b3072cd11f40eb57fd259555264476c6,03:03,"CA: I think it's probably good to dive straight in with the anxiety that I know a lot of people are feeling right now. So many reasons to be anxious, both for yourself, your loved ones, and just for this time and for the world and how we all get through this. Have you been feeling anxiety, Liz? And how do you think of it? What can you say to us? "
b3072cd11f40eb57fd259555264476c6,03:28,"EG: I have been, and I think you would have to be either a sociopath or totally enlightened not to be feeling anxiety at a moment like this. So I would say that the first thing that I would want to encourage everybody to do is to give themselves a measure of mercy and compassion for the difficult emotions that you're feeling right now. They're extremely understandable. I think sometimes our emotions about our emotions become a bigger problem, so if you're feeling frightened and anxious, and then you're layering shame on top of that because you feel like you should be handling it better, or you should be doing your isolation better, or you should be creating more while you're alone, or you should be serving the world in some better way, now you've just multiplied the suffering, right? So I think that the antidote for that, first of all, is just a really warm, loving dose of compassion and mercy towards yourself, because if you're in anxiety, you're a person who is suffering right now, and that deserves a show of mercy. "
b3072cd11f40eb57fd259555264476c6,04:28,"The second thing that I would say about anxiety is this, that here's what I think is the central paradox of the human emotional landscape that I'm finding particularly fascinating right this moment, and it's really come to light for me. So there are these two aspects of humanity that don't match -- hence the word paradox -- but they really define us. And the first is that there is no species on earth more anxious than humans. It's a hallmark of our species, because we have the ability slash curse to imagine a future. And also, once you've lived on earth for a little while, you have the experience to recognize this terrifying piece of information, which is that literally anything can happen at literally any moment to literally any person. And because we have these vast, rich, colorful imaginations, we can see all sorts of terrifying movies in our heads about all of the possibilities and all of the scariest things that could occur. And actually, one of the scariest things that could occur is occurring. It's something that people have imagined in fiction and imagined in science, and it's actually happening right now, so that's quite terrifying. The paradox is that, in that level, we're very bad, emotionally, at fear and anxiety, because we stir ourselves up to a very heated degree because of our imaginations about how horrible it can get, and it get can get very horrible, but we can imagine it even worse. "
b3072cd11f40eb57fd259555264476c6,05:51,"The paradox is that we're also the most capable, resourceful and resilient species that has ever lived on earth. So history has shown that when change comes to humanity -- either on the global level, like it's happening now, or on the personal level -- we're really good at it. We're really good at adaptation. And I think that if we can remember that, it can help to actually mitigate the fear. And you can remember it in a historical perspective, by looking at what humanity has gone through, and what we have not only survived but figured out how to thrive through. And you can also look at it at a personal level, where you can make an inventory of what you yourself have survived, and notice, as I often notice, my panic and my anxiety about the imagined future is deadly on my nervous system, but I actually have discovered that when there's an actual emergency in the moment, I tend to be pretty good at it. And I think most of us are like that. You'll see that repeated in history in so many examples. I think about those heartbreaking and devastating phone messages that people were leaving for their loved ones from the towers on September 11th, and you can hear the calm, the calm in peoples' voices. The biggest emergency ever was happening, and in that moment, intuition told them what to do. The important thing to do now is to make this phone call. And I think if you can trust that when the point of emergency actually arrives, you'll be able to meet it, and then when the world changes, you'll be able to adapt to it -- it certainly helps me calm down. "
b3072cd11f40eb57fd259555264476c6,07:24,"CA: I mean, I guess there's a reason why fear is there. It didn't just evolve by accident. It's supposed to direct our behavior and help us avoid danger, and it's just that sometimes, it gets out of control and actually gets in our way and damages us. I mean, any specific advice on how someone could turn their fear into something useful, at this moment? "
b3072cd11f40eb57fd259555264476c6,07:50,"EG: Can I tell you a story that I'm using as a touchstone for myself right now and drawing wonder and inspiration from? So, some of you may have heard of a young woman named Amanda Eller. She was in the news recently, because she got lost in Hawaii in the wilderness for 17 days, and there was a massive, massive hunt for her, because she had left her car, she'd gone for a simple hike, had left her phone in her car, went up into the woods, took a wrong turn, and then had this disastrous 17 days, fell off a cliff, broke her leg, walked for 40 miles on a broken knee, lost her shoes in a flash flood. She had to sleep packed in mud in order to protect herself from the cold and the mosquitoes. She was eating moths. I mean, just a harrowing story of survival. I met her recently, and she was so lit and radiant with this kind of serenity and this kind of wonder and joy, and I said, ""How are you like this? You went through one of the most traumatizing things that a person could go through."" She said, ""First of all, I discovered that I can survive anything,"" going back to this idea of how resourceful and adaptive humans actually are. But the piece of her story that I am using like a life raft right now is that she said, on her second day in the jungle, when she realized that she was truly and very much in trouble -- she'd already spent one night in the woods and she was completely lost and she was totally alone and no one knew where she was, and she was full of terror -- she said she closed her eyes and she prayed or asked or requested, she made a wish to herself, to consciousness, to the universe, and she said, ""Please take my fear away, and when I open my eyes, have it be gone, and have it be gone and have it not come back."" And she opened her eyes, and it was gone, and it was replaced by intuition. And I think intuition is a little bit the opposite of fear, because fear is the terror that you feel about a frightening imagined future. Intuition can only happen when you're in the moment. And so, from that point forward, she did not experience fear for the rest of the time she was in the woods. She just was guided by some deep intuitive sense, located somewhere between her sternum and her navel, and in every moment, she would ask it, ""Right or left?"" ""Up or down?"" ""Eat this? Don't eat this?"" And just trust it. Complete, absolute surrender to the intuition of the moment. And she said it hasn't returned, the fear hasn't returned, and she still guides her life that way. So it's a return to some sense that there's a navigational system within you that will, if you stay present in this actual moment, tell you what to do one moment to the next. Now, if you want to suffer, pop out of the moment and imagine a future, and then you can suffer indefinitely. So it is almost like a spiritual or meditation practice, and anybody out there who's done any spiritual or meditation practices, this is what you were practicing for. You were practicing for this moment, and those of you who haven't tried that, this might be a really [inaudible] to be centered in the instant. "
b3072cd11f40eb57fd259555264476c6,10:57,"CA: Wow, that's a remarkable story, and I guess what I'm hearing is two things. It's one, just the reaching out to the universe there, but specifically, there was a decision to let go of the future and just to focus on the moment. "
b3072cd11f40eb57fd259555264476c6,11:15,"EG: That's it, yeah. Nothing will bring you more pain than the future, and what I'm seeing happening right now -- I said this to you the other day, Chris -- is there's a relatively small percentage of the population who will suffer physically from this disease, and there's a larger percentage who are going to suffer economically from it. But then there's this massive, uncountable number of people who will and are suffering from it emotionally, and right now, those people are my concern, because they're really in pain, and there's millions and millions of them. "
b3072cd11f40eb57fd259555264476c6,11:46,"CA: So you're living there by yourself, Liz, and many others are in that same circumstance right now. I suspect some are feeling, like, crushing loneliness. Talk about that. How do you handle loneliness in a situation like this, when it's so alien to everything that we as a social species are usually about? We crave other people. We crave touch. We crave hugs. We want to be there with people. How can we avoid this being a period of crushing loneliness? "
b3072cd11f40eb57fd259555264476c6,12:20,"EG: I don't think you can avoid it, but I think you can walk toward it. And I think that, for me, I've deliberately, many times in my life, gone off into isolation in order to face those things. I've gone on long meditation retreats. This year, I was in India, and I spent 17 days alone with no contact with anybody, which was a weird practice run for what's happening right now. And as I see people really losing it and feeling like they're crawling out of their skin, either from anxiety, fear, boredom, anger, blame, loneliness, depression, all of these things that come up when you are forced to just be in your own presence. I know all of those feelings because, as a meditator, I've experienced all of those, in stillness. The hardest person in the entire world to be with is yourself, and so the only way that I learned, as a meditator, to be able to survive and endure my own company was with universal human compassion toward me, and to recognize that this is a person who is suffering right now from loneliness, and this person needs kindness from self towards self. And it's a very high teaching, but I think that it's a very interesting moment to practice that. And so what I would suggest to people -- and again, this takes a certain amount of resolve and it takes a certain amount of curiosity about learning more about the human experience -- what I'm seeing people do is people are spinning away from that isolation because they're so terrified of it. What happened with the world right now is that basically all of our pacifiers were yanked out of our mouths. Everything that we ever can do and reach for that can get us out of having to be in the existential crisis of being alone with ourselves was taken away. And I see people rushing to fill it, I mean, constant Zoom meetings and constant parties online and constant interaction, and all of that is lovely, but from a spiritual and psychological standpoint, from a creative standpoint, I would say if you have any curiosity about this, don't be in such a hurry to rush away from an experience that could actually transform your life. I think sometimes the experiences that can transform us the most intimately are the ones that we want to run away from, and I think of a story that the Dalai Lama told about one of his teachers. When the Chinese invaded Tibet, and all the monks were running into India for safety, one of his teachers, who was one of the great masters, the last glimpse that the Dalai Lama had of him was that he was walking into China -- very patiently and very slowly, toward it. Everybody else was running away from it -- he was walking toward it, and I think there's a level at which first responders do that, and in the real world, in an intimate way, they go into the emergency, they go toward the emergency. All the people who are trying to solve this now in worldly ways are walking toward the emergency. But there's a way that you can do it emotionally as well and that is to walk with curiosity and with an open mind toward your most difficult and painful emotions without resistance, and say, ""What is it like for a person to feel like they don't have something to do for an hour?"" "
b3072cd11f40eb57fd259555264476c6,15:33,"And you can open up your compassion in that. There's so many lessons in compassion that can be found here. How about a general universal mercy that we can all feel toward people who are in solitary confinement. Let's have that be part of the conversation. Now you've experienced it for two days in your own house. Maybe it's time to change the prison system? You see how hard this is. Or you can have compassion toward people who have lost a loved one and they're alone. By feeling your own feelings, you can open up your feelings more universally toward the world. So I think there's a great opportunity here for growth on the personal level, but you have to have almost a whimsical curiosity to be the one walking into China rather than the one away from it. And that's how I'm doing it right now. "
b3072cd11f40eb57fd259555264476c6,16:18,"CA: So let's follow up on that word ""curiosity"" that you've used a few times there. I mean, a lot of wisdom that I've heard sort of thrown around online right now is, ""This is a great time to follow your passion and dive deep into whatever it is you've most been wanting to do."" I mean, in ""Big Magic,"" you made an argument that following your passion isn't necessarily the wisest strategy. You argued, no, don't do that, follow curiosity. Does that apply now? Make that case. "
b3072cd11f40eb57fd259555264476c6,16:47,"EG: Yeah, you know, I've been on a personal crusade to rid the world of the world ""passion"" as an instruction for people on how as they should be living, because I know that in my case, it brings me nothing but anxiety. ""Purpose"" is another one that has become a cudgel that we use to bludgeon ourselves into thinking that we're not doing enough or that we're doing life right or that you're supposed to be more useful, more productive, you're supposed to be changing the world, or uncovering some particular talent that only you have and with it, you're supposed to transform everybody and monetize it, no pressure. I start to get hives even repeating that, but that's what we've been taught, that purpose and passion are everything. I would like to replace it with a far gentler word, and I think ""curiosity"" is very gentle, because the stakes are so much lower. The stakes of passion say you have to shave your head and move to India and get rid of all your possessions and start up, like -- It's so intense. But curiosity is a very simple, universal experience that causes you to want to look at something just a tiny bit closer, and you don't have to change your life around it. You just look, and it might be taking a weekend to try something new for a little while. It's almost so easily missed, and I think so many times, we're looking way up at the sky for the sign from God of what our passion and what our purpose is supposed to be, and meanwhile, there's this lovely little trail of breadcrumbs of curiosity that if you can slow down -- and again, this is about not rushing out of the experience of being silent, still and alone -- if you can slow down, you might be able to see them. But if I could say one thing I'm noticing is an obstacle right now -- because I think a lot of people thought, ""Isolation, great, this is the perfect time for me to learn Italian and take that calligraphy class and start writing that novel,"" and they find that they're actually in a paralysis of anxiety and they're not creating anything or doing anything. First of all, again, like, a blanket of mercy on you. These are hard times, and it might take you a minute in your nervous system and your mind to adjust to the new reality. But the second thing I would say is that when people are saying they're having trouble with their creativity because they're in isolation, I might daringly suggest that perhaps you're not in enough isolation. And by that I mean, are you monitoring how much external stimulus you're bringing of this disaster into your home? So if you're sitting watching the news all day, what you're doing is you're bringing the disaster into your work space. You're bringing it into your soul. You're bringing it into your mind. And you're going to create the opposite of a creative environment, an environment of fear, panic and urgency. So I think if you're going to be a good steward of your creativity right now, you have to isolate a little bit from the news. And that doesn't mean disconnecting, it means I get up every morning and after I've meditated, I read the New York Times and I give myself 40 minutes with it, and then that's it for the day, because I know that if I bring in any more, I'm going to go into a traumatized state and then I won't be able to follow my intuition, I won't be able to help people, because I myself will be suffering, and I won't be able to be present for this very interesting moment in my life and in history, and I want to remain present for it as much as I can. So there's a discipline of being a good steward of your senses and deciding what you're going to put your senses in front of. "

b3072cd11f40eb57fd259555264476c6,20:16,"HW: Liz, there's an outpouring on Facebook of gratitude for you. People are so grateful, and grateful for the calm that you are instilling in us all, so thank you, from them and from me. We've also had a number of questions about grief. We're kind of dealing with grief at a different scale at the moment. One person has already lost five people to coronavirus. And so any thoughts of how to manage grief at this scale or how to process this in a way that honors both them and yourself? "
b3072cd11f40eb57fd259555264476c6,20:51,"EG: First of all, my condolences. And I think any words that I would say about somebody who just lost five family members could only be inadequate. Grief is bigger than us. It's bigger than your efforts to manage it, and if you want to hold yourself and your family members compassionately through grief, you have to allow that it cannot be managed. And I think that grief management is something that we've kind of created in our very Western idea that if we can figure out something, we can avoid suffering from it, so if we can figure out how to translate grief and if we can figure out how to walk through grief, then we won't have to experience the magnitude of it. Many of you know that I lost the love of my life two years ago from pancreatic and liver cancer, and I was with her when she died, and I've been walking through my own path of grief, so I know what it feels like to lose the person in the world who is the most important to you, which is of course the biggest fear that we all have. I know that you can survive it, but I know that you survive it by allowing yourself to feel it. And again, to go back to the metaphor of the monk walking directly into China, into conflict rather than away from it, do you have the courage to let it break over you like waves? I wish I could remember her name. There's this extraordinary woman who wrote a book called ""Here If I Need You,"" and she's a chaplain for the police department in Maine, and she's in charge of knocking on people's doors and giving them the worst news they're ever going to hear in their life, when she goes with the police when something happens. And she told a story once that I found very moving and very helpful for me in my grief. She said what she'd witnessed through years and years of sitting with people through what is literally the worst moment of their life, the nightmare of that loss, is that when she knocks on that door and tells that person, your daughter, your family member, your husband, your mother has been killed, there's this universal collapse where the person will just be -- it is the tidal wave that comes and just takes you down and you lose all civilization, you lose all your attainments, all your wisdom. Nothing can stand up to that. You literally go to the floor. And you sob and you grieve, and she holds them through that. And then she said that what she's learned is the most astonishing thing, that that never lasts more than a half an hour, that first wave. It can't. You actually physiologically can't sustain that, and if you let it break over you and you just allow it, then within a half an hour, usually sooner -- and she said this has happened every single time she's been with somebody with a loved one's death -- the very next thing that happens is that that person calms down, they catch a breath, and the next question they ask is a very reasonable question. ""Where is the body? What do we do next? When can we have the funeral? Who else was in the car?"" And with that question, she says, they start to rebuild their new life already with this new piece of information that even an hour ago would have seemed unsurvivable. And she uses that as an example of, once again, the tremendous psychological resilience of a human being. And it doesn't mean that they will never grieve again. It doesn't mean that their grieving journey is over. It just means that, somewhere in their mind, that it's landed, and now, already, they're making a plan about, ""OK, who do we need to notify, what's the next thing we need to do."" "
b3072cd11f40eb57fd259555264476c6,24:29,"And again, if you can remember this as you go through your panic, if you can remember that in the moment of emergency, there will be an intuitive, deep sense that will tell you there's going to be some next steps and it's time for us to take those next steps, and if you can also remember that resilience is our shared genetic and psychological inheritance -- we are, each and every one of us, no matter how anxious you feel you are, no matter how ridden by fear you feel you are, every single one of us is the genetic survivor of hundreds of thousands of years of survivors. Each one of us came from a line of people who made the next correct intuitive move, survived incredibly difficult things, and were able to pass their genes on. So almost to the biological level, you can relax into a trust that when the moment comes where you will be faced with the biggest challenge, you will be able to draw on a deep reservoir of shared human consciousness that will say, ""Now it's time to make the next move, and we can do this."" "
b3072cd11f40eb57fd259555264476c6,25:32,HW: So beautiful. So many more questions. I will be back.

b3072cd11f40eb57fd259555264476c6,25:42,"CA: I guess that's a book, if you need a book right now, ""Here If You Need Me"" by Kate Braestrup. "

b3072cd11f40eb57fd259555264476c6,25:48,"CA: Liz, you and I got to have a conversation a few months after Rayya passed away. It was actually the first-ever episode of the TED Interview podcast we did. And I found that it was probably my favorite episode ever of the TED Interview. And it was so moving how you spoke about your grief then. And I feel like that's a potential resource to people. I know we were both sitting there shedding tears, and I found that an extraordinary experience personally, to be sure. But somehow ... in this moment, if you follow this journey of curiosity, if you walk towards some of the harder moments, do you think that this actually can be a creative time for people if they're willing to do that? "
b3072cd11f40eb57fd259555264476c6,26:46,"EG: Absolutely, and I don't think creativity in this case has to necessarily mean that you write the Great American Novel or start that business you always intended to start. It doesn't need to be so literal. We're going to be creating new worlds and new lives on the other side of this, and we're going to be doing that individually and we're going to be doing that collectively. I think of the shoots of small trees that can only come up after massive forest fires, where seed pods have to explode under great heat. We're in a kind of crucible moment right now, and I wouldn't begin to have the hubris to predict what sort of creativity will come, but look, if history is any measure, what we'll probably see is people at their best and people at their worst. But I think we'll see more of people at their best, because that's typically how it works. "
b3072cd11f40eb57fd259555264476c6,27:44,"CA: I mean, your model of how creativity happens is that it doesn't all come from within. It's not like you have to sit there, saying, ""OK, this is my moment to be creative. Come on. Be creative. Be creative."" It involves, fundamentally, an openness to something coming to you, to be open, to be curious, listening, but then just to be open to that moment. Perhaps that could apply even more now than ever, just because we have this huge distraction of the news, some other distractions are taken away. Is there a chance that if people listened, they actually can receive more at this moment? "
b3072cd11f40eb57fd259555264476c6,28:28,"EG: I think so, and I think, again, if you stop thinking about your self-isolation and your social distancing as quarantine and you start thinking of it as a retreat, you'll find that you can't really tell the difference between quarantine and retreat. You know, a lot of you out there have dreamed, I've heard you, because I talked about going to India to an ashram for four months and God, I can't tell you how many people I've heard say, ""I wish I could do that."" I'm like, ""Well, you got it."" And by the way, this is what it felt like. This is what it felt like to learn how to be present with yourself. I think my screen needs to move a bit. To learn how to be present with yourself means sitting in a lot of terror, sitting in a lot of anxiety, sitting in a lot of fear, sitting in a lot of shame, and being able to allow that without having to resist it, without having to reach outside yourself for something to numb yourself with. "
b3072cd11f40eb57fd259555264476c6,29:29,"I also want to tell a story that a friend of mine, Martha Beck, told me about when she goes to South Africa and teaches animal-tracking courses. And she works with all these great African animal trackers, and these old men who have had these skills passed down for generations. And she was using it as an example of the difference between focus and openness. So I think sometimes the mistake people make when they want to be creative is they think they have to get really focused, and focus is an anxiety-producing energy as well. You've got to drill down and you feel your whole body tense. But what she described witnessing in these animal trackers is when they go out to hunt the lions, these old, old men, the very first thing they do is they sit down against a tree and they appear to go to sleep. They drop into a state that she calls and that the mystics call ""wordless oneness."" And wordless oneness, you can also call meditation. You can also call it the zone. But it's a stillness where you actually can drop your nervous system into such a quiet place that you have 360-degree awareness of your senses and of presence. And they'll sit like that, apparently doing nothing, for an extremely long time, just looking through half-lidded eyes at the world. And then, maybe an hour, two hours in, all of the sudden, they'll say, ""The lion's over there."" And so for me, I've learned to hold my creative wishes lightly in that same way. I'm between books right now and I don't have an idea for a book and in the past, that would have made me really anxious, but now I know -- take a lot of naps, go for a lot of walks, do a lot of drawings. I'm doing weird little art projects as I'm sitting here, to distract my mind. "

b3072cd11f40eb57fd259555264476c6,31:30,"EG: Well, I'm just playing with color and texture because it calms me, and I think if you can't think of what to do right now, I would suggest doing what you used to do when you were 10 years old that made you feel happy and relaxed, and that's often creativity and play. And for many of us who were anxious children -- and I was an anxious child -- we learned at an early age that we could sedate ourselves with our curiosity and with our play, and then, usually around adolescence, the world taught us that there were faster and more immediate ways to bump out of that anxiety through sex or substances or distraction or workaholism or whatever we did and not have to sit with ourselves. And I think right now is a really good opportunity -- You actually were on the right track when you were 10, whatever it was. So, you know, get some LEGOs. Get some LEGOs, get some coloring books, just get your hands in the mud, do whatever it is that will actually ground you into this, again, to take you out of the futurizing and the future-tripping that's going to cause you nothing but anxiety and not going to make you be of service. "
b3072cd11f40eb57fd259555264476c6,32:33,"There's such a thing, too, that I just want to touch on if I can, for a minute, about empathetic overload and empathetic meltdown. We're taught that empathy is a good thing. I would suggest that in a case this traumatic, what you want to talk about replacing empathy with is compassion, and the difference is extremely important. So compassion means ""I'm actually not suffering right now, you are, I see your suffering, and I want to help you."" That's what compassion is. Empathy is ""You're suffering, and now I'm suffering because you're suffering."" So now we have two people suffering and nobody who can serve, and nobody who can be of help, and if you knew how your empathetic suffering actually makes you into another patient who needs assistance, you would be more willing to dip into compassion. And what underlies compassion is the virtual courage, the courage to be able to sit with and witness somebody else's pain without inhabiting it yourself so much that you become another person who is suffering and now, there are no helpers. And it takes an enormous amount of courage to be able to watch that without diving into it and joining it and becoming sick yourself. "
b3072cd11f40eb57fd259555264476c6,33:46,"CA: I mean, if empathy is just a feeling, does compassion, your use of compassion imply that it's turning that feeling into something potentially practical to actually do something, if you can, for that person? "
b3072cd11f40eb57fd259555264476c6,33:59,"EG: It's recognizing that if I feel your pain, I can't help you in your pain, because now my pain has taken over me, and sometimes, I think all you need to do is know that and it makes you turn the ship. Right? One of my favorite teachers, Byron Katie, says, ""My favorite thing about my suffering is that it isn't yours."" ""My favorite thing about my suffering is that it isn't yours. My favorite thing about your suffering is that it isn't mine."" So it will be, eventually, we all take a turn suffering. You cannot move through this earth without it. When it's your turn, you'll know. When it's not your turn, stay out of that field of somebody else's pain, because you can't help them when you're in pain yourself. And then see if you can find the inner resolve and courage. And I think some of that is just based on accepting the Buddhist First Noble Truth, which is that suffering is an unavoidable aspect of life on earth. We're all going to be in it at some point. We've all been in it at some point. And now, how can I help? I'm not saying this is easy. I'm just saying, also, if you're suffering from empathetic overload and empathetic meltdown, which means your adrenals are up, your stress is up, your endorphins are down, you're going into a parasympathetic collapse -- this would be another time to discipline yourself to stay away from the news, because you actually will have a breakdown, and you won't be able to help the people around you who are the people who need help. "
b3072cd11f40eb57fd259555264476c6,35:23,"CA: But have you seen any signs that if someone takes that empathy and compassion, let's say, and decides to act in some way, big or small, on behalf of someone, that actually shifts how they feel, that there's a healthiness to that? Or is that the language of just inducing more guilt in people? "
b3072cd11f40eb57fd259555264476c6,35:47,"EG: No, I think there's a beautiful healthiness that can come from being of service, and that's also how I've been medicating my anxiety through this, by showing up in ways that I can with whatever resources I've got. Here's what you have to keep in mind, though, and this is what I keep reminding people. Right now, in my own personal sphere, there is more need than I have resources to fix. So I have to begin with that reality, and I have to have the courage to sit in that reality soberly and acknowledge that that's the case. The second thing I think emotional sobriety would require of me right now is to recognize that this is going to be a marathon, not a sprint. And so the first week of the crisis, I had this deluge of all my really energized, let's-save-the-world friends, all my creative friends, everybody was e-mailing, texting, Zooming, and they all had a response. ""Let's do this! Let's do this! Let's fix it this way!"" And I found myself joining with some of them and not joining with others, just, again, based on my intuition, but I also found myself cautioning them, ""Guys, this is a marathon."" We're in mile one of what's going to be a very long marathon. So pace yourselves, and pace your resources. Don't overgive to the point where you collapse, because we're still going to need helpers two months from now, and we're still going to need helpers six months from now. And so, find a steady pace and be willing to be in it for the entire long haul. "

b3072cd11f40eb57fd259555264476c6,37:24,"HW: Such great advice, Liz, and so many questions pouring in. One of them is from a therapist who confesses that she, and many of her clients, are having trouble with the letting go of control in this moment, and wonders if you have any advice on how to let go of control in order to be willing to feel everything that we're enduring. "
b3072cd11f40eb57fd259555264476c6,37:46,"EG: Just this ... This sense that you had that you had control was a myth to begin with. And that may not be comforting, except that I find it very comforting. You know, control is an illusion, and there are times where we're able to fool ourselves because we're so good at technology, we're so good at creating safe worlds where we're able to trick ourselves into believing that we're in control of any of this. But we're not, and the paradox, for me, of surrender is how relaxing it is. Nobody ever wants to surrender, because nobody wants to lose control, but if you recognize that you never had control, all you ever had was anxiety, and then you let go of the myth of control, you'll find that, I find that if I even say that sentence, ""I'm losing control,"" and then I remind myself, ""You never had control, all you had was anxiety, and that's what you're having right now."" So you're not letting go of anything. Surrender means letting go of something you never even had. So there's an awakening that's happening right now, where what's happening is not that you're losing control. What's happening is that, for the first time, you're noticing that you never had it. And the world is doing its job. The job of the world is to change, constantly, and sometimes radically, and sometimes immediately, and it's doing its job, and that is also the norm of things. And again, we are adaptive and we're resilient and we can handle it. But I don't kid myself for a minute to think that I'm in control of anything that's ever happening. My realm of control is extremely small. It's usually about, like, might be able to go get a glass of water right now. Like, there's not a lot that I'm in control of. And I'm actually (Inaudible) I've ever been. "
b3072cd11f40eb57fd259555264476c6,39:42,"HW: One more question from online, if I may, and then I will jump off again. You know, Chris, you and I, we're all in a pretty privileged position. TED has been able to go remote. We're able to work remotely. But many, many, many millions of people in the US and beyond are not able to do that, and people are really suffering. How can we help? What are your thoughts about people who are not able to socially distance, who are losing their jobs, the global catastrophe that is unveiling? How can we think about that in a humane and compassionate way? "
b3072cd11f40eb57fd259555264476c6,40:24,"EG: It's crushing, and again, as with the same case of the person who said they had lost five family members, I can't, sitting in this position of comfort and safety, say anything that I think is going to be accurate and appropriate to that, other than to say that I just think of this Indian proverb that I keep going back to, which is, ""I store my grain in the belly of my neighbor."" Western, capitalistic society has taught and trained us to hoard long before this, long before this happened and people were hoarding toilet paper and canned goods. Advertising and the whole capitalist model has taught us scarcity, it's taught us that you have to be surrounded by abundance in order to safe. The disconnect between those who have and those who have not has never been bigger, and never in my lifetime, and probably in any of our lifetimes, has there been an invitation, again, to release the stranglehold on your hoarding. This is not the time for hoarding. This is the time to store your grain in the belly of your neighbor, in a way that is emotionally sober and accurate to what you can give, and to look at that in a really honest way, to not put your own family in danger, to not put yourself in crisis, but to be able to say, ""What can I offer in the immediacy?"" And then, in the longer term, a conversation about redistribution of resources, and why do so few have so much and why do so many have so little? But that's not a conversation I can fix today. That's, again, outside of my realm of control. But what I can do is unleash the white-knuckled grip that I have on what's mine and make sure that I'm going into the world with an open hand -- again, not a panicked open hand, where I'm going to destroy myself to save somebody else, because then there will be no helper left, but in a reasonable way. I cannot save everybody. I can save a few. And that's the tragic, but, I think, sobering reality that I can offer right now, and again, underlying all of that, undergirding all of that is a recognition that anything that I have to say about people who are in extraordinary suffering right now is not enough.

Like, I think a lot of, just from the conversation we just had, or just listening to you there, there are so many reasons to feel angry right now about what's going on. And part of me feels we should be. That's what anger is for. It's to highlight things that are unjust and unfair and that we must pay attention to, and yet part of me is honestly scared of it. I think there could be an eruption of anger that's dangerous, both personally and for society. Have you felt anger? What are you doing with it? "
b3072cd11f40eb57fd259555264476c6,43:43,"EG: I feel anger at every White House press conference, and I think all thinking people do. I feel angry that this wasn't taken more seriously early on. I feel angry at myself that I didn't take it more seriously early on. As much as I feel contempt and disgust for government officials who I feel were slow to recognize how serious this is, I also have to be really candid that three weeks ago, I was one of the people walking around saying, ""Why is everybody overreacting to this so much?"" So I think we also have to own our own piece of that, and I think there are rolling waves of awakening that are happening in people, and so a lot of the anger I feel right now is for people who aren't taking this seriously enough, who aren't quarantining themselves, who are putting other people in danger. But a month ago, that was me. I was in the Hong Kong airport, sallying through the Hong Kong airport while everybody was scurrying around in masks and gloves, and I was like, ""What's the big deal?""

It's like, don't be so silly. Look at what actually matters here. And we can at least focus more attention onto the things that, yes, some things that we really should be angry about, but other things that maybe ... you know, could lead people to say human connection really matters in this moment. People from all sides, we need each other. We just have to use this as a moment when we come together. How do you think about that?

One thing that I'm noticing that I'm, like, a little bit amused by is that when people start predicting what the post-pandemic world is going to be, I notice that their predictions seem to be, suspiciously, in exact alignment with their personal worldview.

My friends who are dystopians are already predicting that this is the official beginning of the police state and the disastrous new world order.

Personally, whatever role I have in the public sphere. "
b3072cd11f40eb57fd259555264476c6,49:23,"CA: You're an extraordinary storyteller and you already told us one amazing story earlier on. Have you come across any other recent stories that have given you reason for hope, perhaps? "
b3072cd11f40eb57fd259555264476c6,49:36,"EG: Well, I'll give you one, and this one, I delight in. Years ago, 20 years ago in New York City -- 30 years ago, I was in my 20s -- I was friends with a woman named Winifred, who was in her 90s. She was this really cool West Village bohemian artist who had lived in Greenwich Village for her entire life, had had a very storied and checkered and wild life, surrounding herself with intellectuals and poets and artists and adventure, and she'd had a lot of loss and a lot of gain, and she was this extremely passionate person who had friends of all ages, which was something I admired about her. I was friends with her. I was 25, she was 95. But I would call her my very good friend, and she had a lot of friends. She was so open to everything. And at her 95th birthday party, I asked her, ""What have you learned, more than anything else?"" Because she was such a creature of learning. I wrote about her in ""Big Magic."" I said to her one time, ""What's your favorite book that you've ever read?"" And she said, ""I can't say my favorite book because there's been so many, but I can tell you my favorite subject, the history of ancient Mesopotamia, which I started learning when I was 80 and it changed my life."" And it did. She'd gone on these expeditions to Jordan and Iraq. She was just so full of living, you know? And I said to her, ""What have you learned in all of your experiences? What is the most central thing that you've learned?"" And she said, ""Human beings can adapt to anything. Human beings can adapt to absolutely anything."" And then she said this great line: ""If Martians landed on Earth tomorrow, it would be off the front pages of the newspaper by next Tuesday. We would already be used to it."" Right? And there's a level at which I'm seeing this adaptation happening. And that is both a good and a bad thing. Right? We can get used to totalitarianism, but we can also get used to -- I've gotten used to a world without the love of my life in it. We can adapt. And I keep using that line as a touchstone for myself, because I don't know, nor do I presume to know, what the world is going to be after this. I know that it will be different from the one before. I also just have to point out that all y'all had a lot of complaints about the world we had before, and I do a lot of talking, I do a lot of going around the world, and [I don't remember] any one of you raising your hand in any of the seminars I've taught over the last years, and saying, ""We are living in a golden age and I'm so grateful and appreciative for all that I have,"" now you want that world back, right? So let's actually remember that as we go forward, that this moment, for some of us, that we're in right now, might be one that we look back later and say, ""Wow, actually, that was pretty good, and I didn't have any gratitude for it."" So personally, I'm just hoping that at an intimate level -- and again, this is not a socioeconomic, global political level, but it's an invitation to actually be grateful for the safety that you have and the people that you have, and maybe carry that forward a little bit. Maybe. We're really good at forgetting. Once a crisis is over, we're really good at forgetting our gratitude. It's one of our great gifts. But you might want to make a note to actually try to be grateful for what you have. "
b3072cd11f40eb57fd259555264476c6,52:57,"CA: Thank you, Liz. I think we have a last question from our online friends. "
b3072cd11f40eb57fd259555264476c6,53:01,"HW: Yeah, what crisis, right? So Liz, just a request for a concrete strategy to try and reduce the fear or the shame that is coming at this moment. "
b3072cd11f40eb57fd259555264476c6,53:15,"EG: I'll give you mine, and it may feel weird and out of reach and woo-woo, but I'm beyond that at this point, and it has been a game changer and a life changer for me. I have a 20-year-long practice of writing myself, every day, a letter from Love. Now this may not feel concrete. It may feel very airy. But what it does is that it helps me through my anxiety, and I need it every single day, because I'm anxious every single day. I wake up frightened every day. I wake up shamed every day. I wake up angry every day. All of the difficult emotions that run through the software of a human consciousness are running through my software all the time, and they cause me pain and they cause me fear, and they cause me distress, and they make me sick. So, 20 years ago, when I was going through a very bad divorce and a depression, I began this tactic, and the tactic is that I will sit down with a notebook and I will write to myself, from myself, a letter from Love. And what I mean by ""Love"" is not romantic love. It's the infinite, bottomlessly merciful source of all human compassion. And every single one of these letters begins the same way. It starts with me saying, ""I need you."" It's a dialogue. It starts with me saying, ""I need you,"" and Love saying, ""I'm right here."" And then I say what I'm going through. ""I'm really angry right now. I'm terrified. I'm spinning. I can't sleep. I'm anxious."" And then I just allow to come through my hand whatever, if you could imagine the most loving, compassionate, merciful voice in the world, if they were in the room with you, what would you want them to say? And you say that to yourself. And so for me, that usually is a combination of these sorts of phrases: ""I've got you. I'm right here. I see how distressed you are. It's all right. I don't need you to feel better."" I think a lot of our anxiety is that we want to get out of that feeling as fast as we can, and what Love always says to me is, ""It makes no difference to me whether you're anxious or afraid or angry or hurt. I'm with you, and I'll be with you through this entire thing for however long it takes. I'm not going anywhere. I've got nowhere better to be right now than sitting with you, loving you. I'll be with you at the moment of your death. I was here with you at the moment of your birth. There's nothing you can do to lose me. You can't fail. You can't do this wrong. You are infinitely, bottomlessly loved."" And it's so interesting to me that the opposite of fear in my life, in my emotional landscape, on the color palette, the opposite of fear isn't courage, the opposite of fear is love. And that presence, a sense of, ""I've got you,"" right? Which is the thing that we'd all want somebody to say. ""I've got you, and it's going to be all right."" I would love to know, neurologically, what actually happens in my mind when I do this, but what happens to me physiologically is that my mind, just hearing those words and seeing those words, settles, and then from there, I'm able to take the next intuitive right action the best that I can. "
b3072cd11f40eb57fd259555264476c6,56:23,"CA: Liz, you can say no to this, it may be a totally inappropriate thing to ask, but you don't happen to have a letter from the last day or two that you'd consider reading, all or in part of? I don't know how long they are. "
b3072cd11f40eb57fd259555264476c6,56:35,EG: You're putting me on the spot. Let me see what we've got. Let's see. 
b3072cd11f40eb57fd259555264476c6,56:47,"OK, so here's one. So I was panicking because I want to offer my apartment in New York to a woman who is a COVID-19 nurse who's volunteered to come into New York City to help, and I'm afraid that I'll infect my neighbors if I let her come and stay there. So I was up in the middle of the night, thinking, ethically, is it appropriate for me to do this? So I wrote, ""I need you."" And Love said, ""I'm right here."" And then I said, ""I want to offer that COVID-19 nurse my apartment, but I'm afraid that my neighbors will get infected, and I'm scared, and I don't know what the right move is. Help me."" And Love said, ""I don't actually know what the right answer to that is, but I'm with you."" And I said, ""But what do you think I should do?"" And Love said, ""Why don't you just sit with me right here for a minute and be with me and know that you're held no matter what, that you cannot make the wrong choice, that it doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things. You're my beloved, I've got you. I can see how much you're spinning, I can see how tired you are, and it doesn't matter to me whether you make this decision in the next minute, in the next day, or not at all. I'm with you, and I'll sit with you through this entire thing, and I'll love you no matter what you decide to do at the end of this. I will be just as much with you at the end of this decision as am I with you now."" And then, I said, ""So what do you think I should do?"" And Love says, ""I think you should go get a glass of water, and I think you should lie down and get some rest, and we'll talk about it some more in the morning."" What I have found over the years of writing myself these letters from Love is that Love never gives advice. This is actually really good for all of you who love to give unsolicited advice to people. Love never gives advice beyond, ""Why don't you get a glass of water? Why don't you rest? We'll try this again tomorrow. You're doing your best, this is a hard time, and I've got you."" So I've got 20 years of those journals, and I'm assuming that I'm going to need it for the rest of my life. "

59c641a72b495d522a7932145d6c02b3,00:05,"Autism is something that many people know about. For example, some people think that autistic people are fair-skinned males that speak in monotone and constantly go on and on about the same topic. Some people think that autistic people do not know right from wrong, avoid attention and usually say the wrong thing at the wrong time. Some people think that autistic people are socially awkward and lack humor and empathy. "
59c641a72b495d522a7932145d6c02b3,00:43,"Now if you agree with what I just said, I'm sorry to tell you, but you do not have the right impression of autism. How do I know? Because I have autism. I do have my own obsessions with things like electronics and public transit, but that does not define me. Each of us are different and unique in our own way. "
59c641a72b495d522a7932145d6c02b3,01:12,"However, there is not a lot of information out there on what an autistic life actually looks like, so people often resort to stereotypes. And we see these often in the media. Some of the more common stereotypes in the media include being socially awkward, lacking empathy and even being a supergenius. "
59c641a72b495d522a7932145d6c02b3,01:39,"And the lack of knowledge on autism doesn't stop there either. Did you know that some people are trying to find a cure for autism? That's because they see it as a negative thing, as a disease. Many people are challenging the idea and to us, we think autism is not a disease. It's just another way of thinking and looking at the world. Our brains function differently from most people's brains. Think of it like comparing and Xbox and a PlayStation. They're both highly capable consoles with different programming. But if you put your Xbox game in a PlayStation, it won't work, because the PlayStation communicates differently. "
59c641a72b495d522a7932145d6c02b3,02:28,"When I look in the mirror, I see someone who thinks differently. Oh, and I also see nice hair. "
59c641a72b495d522a7932145d6c02b3,02:42,"But the question is, am I really diseased if I just think differently? The main problem with living autistic in today's society is that the world just isn't built for us. There's so many ways that we can get overwhelmed. For example, the thing that makes me overwhelmed all the time is loud noises, which means I never crank up my music really loud and I usually am not a fan of large parties. But other people on the spectrum might get overwhelmed with things like bright lights or strong smells or gooey textures that all have the potential to create anxiety. Think about all of the social gatherings you've been to in the past. Was there loud music playing? Were there really bright lights? Were there lots of different food smells going on at the same time? Were there lots of conversations happening all at once? Those things may not have bothered you guys, but for someone with autism, they can be quite overwhelming. "
59c641a72b495d522a7932145d6c02b3,04:01,"So in those situations, we do something called stimming, which is like a repetitive motion or a noise or some other random fidgeting that may or may not seem normal. Some people will flap their arms or make a noise or spin. Ya, it's basically our way of zoning out. It can often feel necessary for us to stim. However, it's often frowned upon, and we're forced to hide it. When we're forced to hide our autistic traits like this, it's called masking. And some people mask better than others. I mask so well sometimes that people don't even know I'm autistic until I give them the big reveal. (Laughs) "
59c641a72b495d522a7932145d6c02b3,04:59,"But at the end of the day, it gets really stressful. Even something like doing my homework at night becomes very tiring. Some people think, because of our ability to mask, that this is the cure to autism. However, all it really does is makes us ashamed of showing our true selves. "
59c641a72b495d522a7932145d6c02b3,05:27,"Another common stereotype that is often associated with autism is that autistic people lack empathy. And again, this is not true. I actually have lots of empathy. I'm just not really good at showing it. Whenever a friend is trying to tell me some of the struggles that they're going through, I often don't know how to express my reply. And that is why I don't show as much empathy as my nonautistic friends do. "
59c641a72b495d522a7932145d6c02b3,06:00,"Emotional expression, however much or however little, is difficult for me. And that is because I am bursting inside with every single emotion one feels at all times. Though of course, I cannot express it that way. Otherwise, let's say, happiness, for example, would come out as a huge burst of gleeful wheezing, hand flapping and loud vocal ""woohoos."" "
59c641a72b495d522a7932145d6c02b3,06:31,Whereas you may just smile. 
59c641a72b495d522a7932145d6c02b3,06:37,"Whether it be receiving an awesome birthday gift or listening to a tragic story on the news, I cannot really express my reply without bursting, so once again, I have to mask it in order to appear normal. My inner feelings are unlimited, but my mind only lets me express extremes or nothing. "
59c641a72b495d522a7932145d6c02b3,07:07,"So my ... I am not great with my emotions, and I communicate differently, and because of that, I was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. This diagnosis helps me and my friends and family to know how my mind works. And in the world, approximately one percent of the population is diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. And this number is growing. However, we are still a big minority. And there's still lots of people that do not see us as equals to other people. "
59c641a72b495d522a7932145d6c02b3,07:51,"This is my family. And in my family, there is one other person who is also autistic. My mother. Yes, adult women can also be autistic. My dad and my brother are both nonautistic. Sometimes it can be a bit difficult for us to communicate with each other, however. Sometimes I'll say something like, ""Oh, Toronto's Union Station, right?"" thinking that I can help them to remember certain aspects of it. When they get confused, I often have to elaborate myself on that. And we often have to say things in a number of different ways so that everyone understands. However, despite all that, we all love each other and respect each other as equals. "
59c641a72b495d522a7932145d6c02b3,08:51,"In his book ""NeuroTribes,"" author Steve Silberman states that autism and other mental conditions should be seen as naturally human, naturally part of a human spectrum and not as defects. And this is something that I agree to completely. If autism was seen as part of a natural human spectrum, then the world could be designed to work better for autistic people. I am not ashamed of my autism. And I may not think like you, or act like you, but I am still human and I am not diseased. "
59c641a72b495d522a7932145d6c02b3,09:37,Thank you. 
d227f2faf6ec185e54436d86463f499b,00:06,"According to legend, once every thousand years a host of sea monsters emerges from the depths to demand tribute from the floating city of Atlantartica. As the ruler of the city, you’d always dismissed the stories… until today, when 7 Leviathan Lords rose out of the roiling waters and surrounded your city. Each commands 10 giant kraken, and each kraken is accompanied by 12 mermites. Your city’s puny army is hopelessly outmatched. "
d227f2faf6ec185e54436d86463f499b,00:41,"You think back to the legends. In the stories, the ruler of the city saved his people by feeding the creatures a ransom of pearls. The pearls would be split equally between the leviathans lords. Each leviathan would then divide its share into 11 equal piles, keeping one, and giving the other 10 to their kraken commanders. Each kraken would then divide its share into 13 equal piles, keeping one, and distributing the other twelve to their mermite minions. If any one of these divisions left an unequal pile or leftover pearl, the monsters would pull everyone to the bottom of the sea. Such was the fate of your fabled sister city. "
d227f2faf6ec185e54436d86463f499b,01:28,"You rush to the ancient treasure room and find five chests, each containing a precisely counted number of pearls prepared by your ancestors for exactly this purpose. Each of the chests bears a number telling how many pearls it contains. Unfortunately, the symbols they used to write digits 1,000 years ago have changed with time, and you don’t know how to read the ancient numbers. With hundreds of thousands of pearls in each chest, there’s no time to recount. "
d227f2faf6ec185e54436d86463f499b,02:00,One of these chests will save your city and the rest will lead to its certain doom. Which do you choose? 
d227f2faf6ec185e54436d86463f499b,02:07,Pause the video to figure it out yourself. 
d227f2faf6ec185e54436d86463f499b,02:09,Answer in 3 
d227f2faf6ec185e54436d86463f499b,02:10,Answer in 2 
d227f2faf6ec185e54436d86463f499b,02:12,Answer in 1 
d227f2faf6ec185e54436d86463f499b,02:15,"There isn’t enough information to decode the ancient Atlantartican numeral system. But all hope is not lost, because there’s another piece of information those symbols contain: patterns. If we can find a matching pattern in arabic numerals, we can still pick the right chest. "
d227f2faf6ec185e54436d86463f499b,02:34,"Let’s take stock of what we know. A quantity of pearls that can appease the sea monsters must be divisible by 7, 11, and 13. Rather than trying out numbers at random, let’s examine ones that have this property and see if there are any patterns that unite them. Being divisible by 7, 11, and 13 means that our number must be a multiple of 7, 11, and 13. Those three numbers are all prime, so multiplying them together will give us their least common multiple: 1001. That’s a useful starting place because we now know that any viable offering to the sea monsters must be a multiple of 1001. "
d227f2faf6ec185e54436d86463f499b,03:17,"Let’s try multiplying it by a three digit number, just to get a feel for what we might get. If we try 861 times 1001, we get 861,861, and we see something similar with other examples. "
d227f2faf6ec185e54436d86463f499b,03:33,"It’s a peculiar pattern. Why would multiplying a three-digit number by 1001 end up giving you two copies of that number, written one after the other? Breaking down the multiplication problem can give us the answer. 1001 times any number x is equal to 1000x + x. For example, 725 times 1000 is 725,000, and 725 x 1 is 725. So 725 x 1001 will be the sum of those two numbers: 725,725. And there’s nothing special about 725. Pick any three-digit number, and your final product will have that many thousands, plus one more. "
d227f2faf6ec185e54436d86463f499b,04:22,"Even though you don’t know how to read the numbers on the chests, you can read which pattern of digits represents a number divisible by 1001. As with many problems, trying concrete examples can give you an intuition for behavior that may at first look abstract and mysterious. "
d227f2faf6ec185e54436d86463f499b,04:42,"The monsters accept your ransom and swim back down to the depths for another thousand years. With the proper planning, that should give you plenty of time to prepare for their inevitable return. "
c593d7fd658f9ff5bc0c1aee2e9c917e,00:04,"Hi there. I'm in the habit of saying I would like it if butterflies could talk, but I've been recently reconsidering that, because we already have a pretty loud world. Can you imagine if butterflies were yakking out there all over the place? "
c593d7fd658f9ff5bc0c1aee2e9c917e,00:19,"But I would like to ask butterflies one question, which is, what is the meaning of some of the stories that we humans tell about them? Because remarkably, all over the world, cultures have really similar stories, similar mythologies about butterflies having to do with the human soul. Some cultures tell us butterflies are carrying the souls of children who have died wrongly or too soon, and other cultures tell us that butterflies are carrying the souls of our ancestors among us. This butterfly is called a Kallima inachus. On one side, it looks like a beautiful butterfly, and on the other side, it looks like a leaf, and it folds up like a leaf to elude predators. So now you see it, now you don't, something hidden, something revealed. Maybe we got our ideas about the human soul from this butterfly. "
c593d7fd658f9ff5bc0c1aee2e9c917e,01:06,"So it's possible that butterflies have some sort of outsized role in our afterlife. But in this life, in this world, butterflies are in really serious trouble. "
c593d7fd658f9ff5bc0c1aee2e9c917e,01:17,"This is a moth. Moths and butterflies are related. Moths generally fly at night. This is called ""praedicta,"" because Darwin predicted that it must exist. "
c593d7fd658f9ff5bc0c1aee2e9c917e,01:28,"So today, more than 60 species of butterflies are endangered around the world, but even more than that, insects are declining, declining, declining. In the last 50 years, we've lost nearly 50 percent of the total number of bodies of insects. Now this is a disaster. It could impact us in a more serious way more quickly than climate change, because butterflies don't do that much in the ecosystem that we depend on, but they do things for other creatures that we do depend on, and that's the same story with all insect life. Insect life is at the very foundation of our life-support systems. We can't lose these insects. Biodiversity all over the globe is in a vast decline. Habitat loss, pesticides, herbicides and impacts of climate change. Habitat loss is very serious, and that's where we really have to get developing better, more mindfully. "
c593d7fd658f9ff5bc0c1aee2e9c917e,02:28,"It's the worst of times, we are kind of overloaded with our problems. It's also the best of times -- there's incredibly good news. We have exactly what we need. We have exactly the platform to save nature. It's called citizen science. "
c593d7fd658f9ff5bc0c1aee2e9c917e,02:43,"So citizen science is generally a term used to mean people without a PhD contributing to scientific research. Sometimes, it's called community science, which gets at the communal purpose of citizen science, which is to do something for our commons together. It's amateur science. It's being turbocharged today by vast computing power, statistical analysis and the smartphone, but it's an ancient practice that people have always practiced. It's amateur science. Professional science has its roots in amateur science. "
c593d7fd658f9ff5bc0c1aee2e9c917e,03:14,"Charles Darwin was a citizen scientist. He had no advanced degree, and he worked only for himself. So someone showed Darwin this Madagascar star orchid, which as a spur that's 12 inches long, and the spur is the part of a flower that the nectar is in. So this person showed this to Darwin and said, ""This proves that evolution does not come about in a natural way. This flower proves that only God can make these incredibly bizarre and tricky-looking creatures on the earth, because no insect could possibly pollinate this. God must reproduce it."" And Darwin said, ""No, I'm sure that there is an insect somewhere with a proboscis long enough to pollinate that star orchid."" And he was right. "
c593d7fd658f9ff5bc0c1aee2e9c917e,04:05,"This is a map of the monarch butterfly. So, the monarch butterfly has a different story than that particular moth, but reflects the same kind of fundamental idea that Darwin had called coevolution, and coevolution is at the heart of how nature works, and it's also at the heart of what's going wrong with nature today. So over time, as the moth developed a longer proboscis, so the plant developed a longer spur. Over millions of years, the plant and the moth developed a relationship whereby they both make each other's chances of existence better. The monarch butterfly has a different kind of coevolutionary relationship, and today, it is at the heart of what's going wrong for the monarch butterfly. "
c593d7fd658f9ff5bc0c1aee2e9c917e,04:52,"So this is a map of the monarch butterfly migration. The monarch does this amazing thing, and over the course of a year, it goes over the entirety of North America. It does this in four or five generations. The first generations only live a couple of weeks. They mate, they lay eggs and they die. The next generation emerges as butterflies and takes the next leg of the journey. Nobody knows how they do it. By the time the fifth generation comes back around -- and that one lives longer, they overwinter in Mexico and California -- by the time it gets there, those butterflies are going back to where their ancestors came from, but they've never been there before, and nobody that they're immediately related to has been there before either. We don't know how they do it. "
c593d7fd658f9ff5bc0c1aee2e9c917e,05:37,"The reason we know they do this kind of migration -- and we still have a lot of unanswered questions about the monarch migration -- is because of citizen science. So for decades, people have made observations about monarch butterflies, where and when they see them, and they've contributed these observations to platforms like Journey North. This is a map of some observations of butterflies given to Journey North. And if you can see the dots are coded by what time of year those observations were made. So these massive amounts of data come into a place like Journey North, and they can create a map of this time of over a course of a year of where monarchs go. Also because of citizen science, we understand that monarch butterfly numbers are going down, down, down. So in the 1980s, the overwintering butterflies here in California, there were four million counted. Last year, 30,000. "
c593d7fd658f9ff5bc0c1aee2e9c917e,06:35,(Audience gasps) 
c593d7fd658f9ff5bc0c1aee2e9c917e,06:36,"Four million to 30,000 since the 1980s. The monarchs on the east coast are doing a little better, but they're also going down. "
c593d7fd658f9ff5bc0c1aee2e9c917e,06:44,"OK, so what are we going to do about it? Well, very organically, nobody really asking anybody to do it, people all over the continent are supporting monarch butterflies. "
c593d7fd658f9ff5bc0c1aee2e9c917e,06:55,"The heart of the problem for monarchs is milkweed. It's another coevolutionary relationship, and here's the story. Milkweed is toxic. It has a poison in it that it evolved to deter other insects from eating it, but the monarch developed a different kind of relationship, a different strategy with the milkweed. Not only does it tolerate the toxin, the monarch actually sequesters the toxin in its body, thus becoming poisonous to its predators. Monarch butterflies will only lay their eggs on milkweed, and monarch caterpillars will only eat milkweed, because they need that toxin to actually create what they are as a species. "
c593d7fd658f9ff5bc0c1aee2e9c917e,07:37,"So people are planting milkweed all over the country where we have lost milkweed due to habitat destruction, pesticide use, herbicide use and climate change impacts. You can create a lot of butterfly habitat and pollinator habitat on a windowsill. You go to a native nursery in your area and find out what's native to where you live, and you will bring beautiful things to yourself. "
c593d7fd658f9ff5bc0c1aee2e9c917e,08:01,"Now, citizen science can do even more than rescue monarch butterflies. It has the capacity to scale to the level necessary that we need to mobilize to save nature. And this is an example. It's called City Nature Challenge, and City Nature Challenge is a project of the California Academy of Sciences and the Los Angeles Museum of Natural History. So for four years, City Nature Challenge has enjoined cities all over the globe to participate in counting up biodiversity in their cities. We're up to, like, a million observations of biodiversity collected by people around the globe this past April. The winner this year was South Africa, much to the chagrin of San Francisco. "
c593d7fd658f9ff5bc0c1aee2e9c917e,08:48,"Look at them, they have more biodiversity than we do. It's kind of an interesting thing, what is revealed when you start seeing what are the natural resources where you live, because as we go forward, you want to live where there's more biodiversity. And by the way, citizen science is a very good tool for social justice and environmental justice goals, for helping reach them. You need to have data and you need to show a picture, you need to point to a cause and then you need to have the surgical strike to help support whatever that problem is. "
c593d7fd658f9ff5bc0c1aee2e9c917e,09:16,"So City Nature Challenge, I think, should get a commendation from the UN. Has there ever been a global effort on behalf of nature undertaken in this coordinated manner? It's amazing, it's fantastic and it's really a pretty grassroots thing, and we get very interesting information about butterflies and other creatures when we do these bioblitzes. "
c593d7fd658f9ff5bc0c1aee2e9c917e,09:41,"City Nature Challenge basically works with a tool called iNaturalist, and iNaturalist is your entry drug to citizen science. (Laughs) I suggest signing up for it on a laptop or on a desktop, and then you put the app on your phone. With iNaturalist, you take a picture of a bird, a bug, a snake, anything, and an artificial intelligence function and an expert vetting system works to verify that observation. The app gives the observation the date, the time, the latitude and the longitude, geolocates that observation. That's the data, that's the science of citizen science. And then that data is shared, and that sharing, that is the soul of citizen science. When we share data, we can see much bigger pictures of what's going on. There's no way to see that whole monarch migration without sharing data that's been collected over decades, seeing the heart and soul of how nature works through citizen science. "
c593d7fd658f9ff5bc0c1aee2e9c917e,10:42,"This is a Xerces blue butterfly, which went extinct when it lost its habitat in Golden Gate Park. It had a coevolutionary relationship with an ant, and that's another story. "
c593d7fd658f9ff5bc0c1aee2e9c917e,10:54,"I'll end by asking you, please participate in citizen science in some way, shape or form. It is an amazingly positive thing. It takes an army of people to make it really work. "
c593d7fd658f9ff5bc0c1aee2e9c917e,11:08,And I'll just add that I think butterflies probably really do have enough on their plate without carrying around human souls. 
c593d7fd658f9ff5bc0c1aee2e9c917e,11:18,"But there's a lot we don't know, right? And what about all those stories? What are those stories telling us? Maybe we coevolved our souls with butterflies? Certainly, we are connected to butterflies in deeper ways than we currently know, and the mystery of the butterfly will never be revealed if we don't save them. So, please join me in helping to save nature now. "
c593d7fd658f9ff5bc0c1aee2e9c917e,11:42,Thank you. 
8c1fad5ce0dab8908dee527f88697ce2,00:07,"Working in Vienna at the turn of the 20th century, he began his career as a neurologist before pioneering the discipline of psychoanalysis. He proposed that people are motivated by unconscious desires and repressed memories, and their problems can be addressed by making those motivations conscious through talk therapy. His influence towers above that of all other psychologists in the public eye. But was Sigmund Freud right about human nature? And were his methods scientific? "
8c1fad5ce0dab8908dee527f88697ce2,00:39,"Order, order. Today on the stand we have… Dad? "
8c1fad5ce0dab8908dee527f88697ce2,00:44,"Ahem, no, your honor. This is Doctor Sigmund Freud, one of the most innovative thinkers in the history of psychology. "
8c1fad5ce0dab8908dee527f88697ce2,00:52,An egomaniac who propagated pseudoscientific theories. 
8c1fad5ce0dab8908dee527f88697ce2,00:56,"Well, which is it? "
8c1fad5ce0dab8908dee527f88697ce2,00:57,"He tackled issues medicine refused to address. Freud’s private practice treated women who suffered from what was called hysteria at the time, and their complaints hadn’t been taken seriously at all. From the women with depression he treated initially to World War I veterans with PTSD, Freud’s talking cure worked, and the visibility he gave his patients forced the medical establishment to acknowledge their psychological disorders were real. "
8c1fad5ce0dab8908dee527f88697ce2,01:26,He certainly didn’t help all his patients. Freud was convinced that our behavior is shaped by unconscious urges and repressed memories. He invented baseless unconscious or irrational drivers behind the behavior of trauma survivors— and caused real harm. 
8c1fad5ce0dab8908dee527f88697ce2,01:44,How’s that? 
8c1fad5ce0dab8908dee527f88697ce2,01:44,"He misrepresented some of his most famous case studies, claiming his treatment had cured patients when in fact they had gotten worse. Later therapists influenced by his theories coaxed their patients into ""recovering"" supposedly repressed memories of childhood abuse that never happened. Lives and families were torn apart. "
8c1fad5ce0dab8908dee527f88697ce2,02:06,You can’t blame Freud for later misapplications of his work— that would be projecting. 
8c1fad5ce0dab8908dee527f88697ce2,02:11,Plenty of his ideas were harmful without any misapplication. He viewed homosexuality as a developmental glitch. He coined the term penis envy— meaning women are haunted for life by their lack of penises. 
8c1fad5ce0dab8908dee527f88697ce2,02:25,"Freud was a product of his era. Yes, some of the specifics were flawed, but he created a new space for future scientists to explore, investigate, and build upon. Modern therapy techniques that millions of people rely on came out of the work he started with psychoanalysis. And today everyone knows there’s an unconscious— that idea was popularized Freud. "
8c1fad5ce0dab8908dee527f88697ce2,02:48,"Psychologists today only believe in a “cognitive unconscious,” the fact that you aren’t aware of everything going on at a given moment. Freud took this idea way too far, ascribing deep meaning to everything. He built his theories on scientific ideas that were outdated even in his own time, not just by today’s standards— for example, he thought individual psychology is derived from the biological inheritance of events in ancient history. And I mean ancient—  like the Ice Age or the killing of Moses. Freud and his closest allies actually believed these prehistorical traumas had ongoing impacts on human psychology. He thought that the phase of cold indifference to sexuality during pubescence was literally an echo of the Ice Age. With fantastical beliefs like these, how can we take him seriously? "
8c1fad5ce0dab8908dee527f88697ce2,03:43,"Any renowned thinker from centuries past has ideas that seem fantastical by today’s standards, but we can’t discount their influence on this basis. Freud was an innovator linking ideas across many fields. His concepts have become everyday terms that shape how we understand and talk about our own experiences. The Oedipus complex? Ego and id? Defense mechanisms? Death wishes? All Freud. "
8c1fad5ce0dab8908dee527f88697ce2,04:10,But Freud didn’t present himself as a social theorist— he insisted that his work was scientific. 
8c1fad5ce0dab8908dee527f88697ce2,04:17,Are you saying he… repressed inconvenient facts? 
8c1fad5ce0dab8908dee527f88697ce2,04:22,Freud’s theories were unfalsifiable. 
8c1fad5ce0dab8908dee527f88697ce2,04:24,"Wait, so you’re saying he was right? "
8c1fad5ce0dab8908dee527f88697ce2,04:27,"No, his ideas were framed so that there’s no way to empirically verify them. Freud didn’t even necessarily believe in the psychoanalysis he was peddling. He was pessimistic about the impact of therapy. "
8c1fad5ce0dab8908dee527f88697ce2,04:40,What! I think I need to lie down! 
8c1fad5ce0dab8908dee527f88697ce2,04:43,"Many of Sigmund Freud’s ideas don’t hold up to modern science, and his clinical practices don’t meet today’s ethical standards. At the same time, he sparked a revolution in psychology and society, and created a vocabulary for discussing emotion. Freud made his share of mistakes. But is a thinker responsible for how subsequent generations put their ideas to use? Do they deserve the blame, credit, or redemption when we put history on trial? "
fa2133f1e5a865a5a5044777824fe147,00:01,"Would you ever forgive a person who kills a member of your family? In September of 2019, Dallas police officer Amber Guyger was sentenced for murder, and then the brother of the victim forgave her. Brandt Jean was 18 years old, and I joined the rest of the country watching on television in awe at that act of grace. "
fa2133f1e5a865a5a5044777824fe147,00:36,But I also worried. I worried that people who are African American like Brandt Jean are expected to forgive more often than other people. And I worried that a white police officer like Amber Guyger receives a lesser sentence than other people who commit wrongful killings. 
fa2133f1e5a865a5a5044777824fe147,00:58,"But because I'm a law professor, I also worried about the law itself. The law leans so severely towards punishment these days that it's part of the problem. And that's what I want to talk about here. "
fa2133f1e5a865a5a5044777824fe147,01:16,"The powerful example of one individual's forgiveness makes me worry that lawyers and officials too often overlook the tools that law itself creates to allow forgiveness, when the principle should be the cornerstone of a thriving society. I worry that lawyers and officials do not adequately use the tools of forgiveness, by which I mean letting go of justified grievance. And those tools are many. They include pardons, commutations, expungement, bankruptcy for debt and the discretion that's held by police and prosecutors and judges. "
fa2133f1e5a865a5a5044777824fe147,02:02,But I also worry -- I worry a lot -- 
fa2133f1e5a865a5a5044777824fe147,02:05,"I worry that these tools, when used, replicate the disparities, the inequities along the lines of race and class and other markers of advantage and disadvantage. Biases or privileged access are at work when United States presidents pardon people charged with crimes. Historically, white people are pardoned four times as often as members of minority groups for the same crime, same sentence. "
fa2133f1e5a865a5a5044777824fe147,02:39,"Forgiveness between individuals is supported by every religious tradition, every philosophic tradition. And medical evidence now shows the health benefits of letting go of grievances and resentments. As Nelson Mandela led South Africa's transition from apartheid to democracy, he explained, ""Resentment is like drinking a poison and hoping it will kill your enemies."" "
fa2133f1e5a865a5a5044777824fe147,03:11,"Law can remove the penalties for those who apologize and seek forgiveness. For example, in 39 states in the United States and the District of Columbia, there are laws that allow medical professionals to apologize when something goes wrong and not fear that that statement could later be used against them in an action for damages. More actively, bankruptcy law offers debtors, under some conditions, the chance to start anew. Pardons and expungements sealing criminal records can, too. "
fa2133f1e5a865a5a5044777824fe147,03:47,"I have been teaching law for almost 40 years, hard to believe, but recently, I realized that we don't teach law students about the tools of forgiveness that are within the legal system, and nor do law schools usually explore the potential for new avenues for forgiveness that law can adopt or assist. These are lost opportunities. These are lost obligations, even, because the students that I teach will become prosecutors, judges, governors, presidents. Barack Obama, my former student, used his power as the President of the United States to give pardons. That released several hundred people from prison after the law changed to provide shorter sentences for the same drug crimes for which they had been convicted. But if he hadn't used his pardon power, they would still be in prison. "
fa2133f1e5a865a5a5044777824fe147,04:50,"Legal tools of forgiveness should be used more, but not without reason and not with bias. A ""New Yorker"" cartoon shows a judge with a big nose and a big mustache looking down at a defendant with the exact same nose and exact same mustache and says, ""Obviously not guilty."" "
fa2133f1e5a865a5a5044777824fe147,05:10,"Forgiveness could undermine the commitment that law has to treat people the same under the same circumstances, to apply rules evenly. In this age of resentment, mass incarceration, widespread consumer debt, we need more forgiveness, but we need a philosophy of forgiveness. We need to forgive fairly. "
fa2133f1e5a865a5a5044777824fe147,05:36,"Contrast the treatment globally of child soldiers with the treatment of juvenile offenders in the United States. International human rights condemn and punish adults who involve children in armed conflict as those most responsible, but treat the children themselves quite differently. The International Criminal Court, now with 122 member nations, convicted Thomas Lubanga, warlord in the [Democratic Republic of the] Congo, for enlisting, recruiting and deploying children, teens, as soldiers. Many nations commit to ensuring that people under the age of 15 do not become child soldiers, and most nations treat those who do become soldiers not as objects of punishment but as people deserving a fresh start. "
fa2133f1e5a865a5a5044777824fe147,06:32,"Compare and contrast how the United States treats juvenile offenders, where we severely punish minors, often moving them to adult courts, even adult prisons. And yet, like child soldiers, teens and children are drawn into violent activity in the United States when there are few options, when they are threatened or when adults induce them with money or ideology. The rhetoric of innocence is resonant when we talk about child soldiers, but not when we talk about teen gang members in the United States. Yet in both settings, youth are caught in worlds that are made by adults, and forgiveness can offer both accountability and fresh starts. "
fa2133f1e5a865a5a5044777824fe147,07:21,"What if, instead, young people caught in criminal activity and violence could have chances to accept responsibility while learning and rebuilding their lives and their own communities? Legal frameworks inviting youth to describe their conduct could also involve community members to hear and forgive. Called ""restorative justice,"" such efforts emphasize accountability and service rather than punishment. Many schools in the United States have turned to use restorative justice methods to resolve conflicts and to prevent them, and to disrupt the school-to-prison pipeline. "
fa2133f1e5a865a5a5044777824fe147,08:04,"Some American high schools have replaced automatic suspensions with opportunities for victims to narrate their experiences and for offenders to take responsibility for their actions. As they describe their experiences and feelings about a theft or hateful graffiti or a verbal or physical assault, the victims and offenders often express strong emotions. And other members of the community take turns describing the impact of the offense on them. The leader is often a student peer, who is trained to deescalate the conflict and orchestrate a conversation about what the offender can do that would help the victim. Together, they come to an agreement about how to move forward, what the wrongdoer can do to repair the injury and what all could do to better avoid future conflicts. "
fa2133f1e5a865a5a5044777824fe147,08:59,"Consider this example, recently in a publication. A young woman named Mercedes M. transferred, in California, from one high school to another after she was so repeatedly suspended in her old high school for getting into fights. And here in her new high school, two other young women accused her of lying and called her the b-word. A counselor came over and talked to her and earned enough trust that she acknowledged she had stolen the shoes of one of the other classmates. Turns out, the three of them had known each other for a long time, and they didn't know any other way to deal with each other other than to fight. "
fa2133f1e5a865a5a5044777824fe147,09:44,"The facilitator invited them to participate in a circle, a confidential conversation about what happened, and they agreed. And initially, each of them expressed a lot of emotion. And then Mercedes apologized. And she said she had stolen the shoes, but she did so because she wanted to sell them and take the money to pay for a drug test so that her mother could show she was clean and try to regain custody of two younger children who were then in state protective care. "
fa2133f1e5a865a5a5044777824fe147,10:24,"The other girls heard this, saw Mercedes crying and they hugged her. They did not ask her to return what she'd stolen, but they did say they wanted a restart. They wanted a reason they could trust her. Later, Mercedes explained that she was sure she would have been suspended if they hadn't had this process. And her high school has reduced suspensions by more than half through the use of this kind of restorative justice method. "
fa2133f1e5a865a5a5044777824fe147,10:52,"Restorative justice alternatives involve offenders and victims in communicating in ways that an adversarial and defensive process does not allow, and it's become the go-to method in places like the District of Columbia juvenile justice system and innovations like Los Angeles's Teen Court. If tuned to fairness, forgiveness methods like bankruptcy would be available not only for the for-profit college that goes belly-up but also for the students stuck with the loans; pardons would not be given to campaign contributors; and black men would no longer have 20 percent longer criminal sentences than do white men, due to how judges exercise discretion. "
fa2133f1e5a865a5a5044777824fe147,11:41,"Forgiveness across the board is one way to avoid such biases. Sometimes, a society just needs a reset when it comes to punishment and debt. The Bible calls for periodic forgiveness of debts and freeing prisoners, and it recently helped to inspire a global movement. Jubilee 2000 joined Pope John Paul II and rock star Bono and over 60 nations in an effort to seek the cancellation and succeed in canceling the debt of developing countries, amounting to over 100 billion dollars of debt canceled, resulting in measurable reduction in poverty. "
fa2133f1e5a865a5a5044777824fe147,12:32,"In a similar spirit, there are people who are copying the techniques of commercial debt collectors who purchase debt for pennies on the dollar and then seek to enforce it. Late-night television host John Oliver partnered with a nonprofit group called RIP Medical Debt, and for only 60,000 dollars, they purchased 15 million dollars' worth of medical debt, and then they forgave it. "
fa2133f1e5a865a5a5044777824fe147,13:07,"That allowed nearly 9,000 people to have a restart in their lives. This kind of precedent should trigger and encourage more such actions. It's time for a reset, given mass incarceration, medical and consumer debt and given indigent criminal defendants who are charged and put in debt because they're expected to pay for their own probation officers and their own electronic monitors. "
fa2133f1e5a865a5a5044777824fe147,13:37,"Forgiving violations of law or promises to pay back loans does pose risks. Forgiveness may encourage more violations. Economists even have a name for it. They call it ""moral hazard."" Should there be amnesty for immigration violations? Should a president offer pardons to protect himself or to induce lawbreaking? These are tough questions for our time. But escalating resentments hold their own dangers. So does attributing blame to individuals for circumstances largely outside their own control. "
fa2133f1e5a865a5a5044777824fe147,14:17,"To ask how law may forgive is not to deny the fact of wrongdoing. Rather, it's to widen the lens to enable glimpses of the larger patterns and to enable new choices that can go forward if we can wipe the slate clean. "

09704782c2fd58e9198a4cc8f04e30d0,00:07,"Flanked by two powerful European nations, the English Channel has long been one of the world’s most important maritime passages. Yet for most of its history, the channel’s rocky shores and stormy weather made crossing a dangerous prospect. Engineers of the early 1800's proposed numerous plans for spanning the 33 kilometer gap. Their designs included artificial islands linked by bridges, submerged tubes suspended from floating platforms, and an underwater passage more than twice the length of any existing tunnel. By the end of the century, this last proposal had captured European imagination. The invention of the tunnel boring machine and the discovery of a stable layer of chalk marl below the seabed made this fantastic tunnel more feasible. But the project’s most urgent obstacles were ones no engineer could solve. "
09704782c2fd58e9198a4cc8f04e30d0,01:06,"At the time, Britons viewed their geographic isolation as a strategic advantage, and fears about French invasion shut down plans for the tunnel. The rise of aerial warfare rendered these worries obsolete, but new economic concerns arose to replace them. Finally, 100 years after the initial excavation, the two countries reached an agreement— the tunnel would proceed with private funding. In 1985, a group of French and British companies invested the modern equivalent of 14 billion pounds, making the tunnel the most expensive infrastructure project to date. "
09704782c2fd58e9198a4cc8f04e30d0,01:46,"The design called for three separate tunnels— one for trains to France, one for trains to England, and one service tunnel between them. Alongside crossover chambers, emergency passages, and air ducts, this amounted to over 200 kilometers of tunnels. In 1988, workers began excavating from both sides, planning to meet in the middle. "
09704782c2fd58e9198a4cc8f04e30d0,02:10,"Early surveys of the French coast revealed the site was full of fault lines. These small cracks let water seep into the rock, so engineers had to develop waterproof boring machines. The British anticipated drier conditions, and forged ahead with regular borers. But only months into the work, water flooded in through undetected fissures. To drill in this wet chalk, the British had to use grout to seal the cracks created in the borer’s wake, and even work ahead of the main borer to reinforce the chalk about to be drilled. "
09704782c2fd58e9198a4cc8f04e30d0,02:46,"With these obstacles behind them, both teams began drilling at full speed. Boring machines weighing up to 1,300 tons drilled at nearly 3.5 meters per hour. As they dug, they installed lining rings to stabilize the tunnel behind them, making way for support wagons following each machine. "
09704782c2fd58e9198a4cc8f04e30d0,03:09,"Even at top speed, work had to proceed carefully. The chalk layer followed a winding path between unstable rock and clay, punctured by over 100 boring holes made by previous surveyors. Furthermore, both teams had to constantly check their coordinates to ensure they were on track to meet within 2 centimeters of each other. To maintain this delicate trajectory, the borers employed satellite positioning systems, as well as paleontologists who used excavated fossils to confirm they were at the right depth. "
09704782c2fd58e9198a4cc8f04e30d0,03:45,"During construction, the project employed over 13,000 people and cost the lives of ten workers. But after two and a half years of tunneling, the two sides finally made contact. British worker Graham Fagg emerged on the French side, becoming the first human to cross the channel by land since the Ice Age. "
09704782c2fd58e9198a4cc8f04e30d0,04:07,"There was still work to be done— from installing crossover chambers and pumping stations, to laying over a hundred miles of tracks, cables, and sensors. But on May 6, 1994, an opening ceremony marked the tunnel’s completion. Full public service began 16 months later, with trains for passengers and rail shuttles for cars and trucks. "
09704782c2fd58e9198a4cc8f04e30d0,04:31,"Today, the Channel Tunnel services over 20 million passengers a year, transporting riders across the channel in just 35 minutes. Unfortunately, not everyone has the privilege of making this trip legally. Thousands of refugees have tried to enter Britain through the tunnel in sometimes fatal attempts. These tragedies have transformed the tunnel’s southern entrance into an ongoing site of conflict. Hopefully, the structure’s history can serve as a reminder that humanity is at their best when breaking down barriers. "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,00:04,"Whitney Pennington Rodgers: Hello everyone, and welcome back to TEDConnects. If you're (Audio feedback) joining us for the -- If you're joining us for the first time, we've been bringing interviews all week with some of the world's greatest minds to help us make sense of this unprecedented moment that we're living in. I'm Whitney Pennington Rodgers, TED's current affairs curator and one of your hosts. This week, thousands of you have tuned in to these live events each day, and hundreds of thousands more have watched these interviews after the fact. We've really loved seeing your questions. They add so much to these conversations. So please keep them coming. In a few minutes, I'm going to disappear to work with our team behind the scenes to monitor our Facebook feed, where you can leave some of your questions. I'll work to figure out which ones are the ones that we can bring back to our guest, and I will ask as many of them as I can during the live interview. Today, we're going to be touching on a subject that I think is top of mind for a lot of people, so I'd like to turn things over to the head of TED, Chris Anderson, who will introduce today's guest. "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,01:07,Chris Anderson: Hello. 
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,01:09,WPR: Hi Chris. How's it going today? 
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,01:11,"CA: Nice to see you again, Whitney. It's going pretty good here. Amazing days. "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,01:16,"WPR: That's good. That's great. We have sunshine here in the Northeast, which is nice. "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,01:22,"CA: So look, I am excited to introduce this guest, because I've known Seth Berkley for a long time. I count him as a friend. He's a man who has really devoted his life to the most profound questions about public health. Vaccines are extraordinary. They save millions of lives. The quest for a coronavirus vaccine is, I think, the biggest single question that the world faces now if we're going to get out of this. So it's just a delight to welcome Dr. Seth Berkley to TED Connects. Come on in, Seth. "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,02:08,"Seth Berkley: Good to see you there, Chris, and delighted to be with you and all of the TED community. "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,02:15,"CA: Well, so look, on Tuesday, Bill Gates was here, and he mentioned that your organization, Gavi, is really at the heart of the quest for a vaccine. So tell us a bit -- what is Gavi? "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,02:32,"SB: So Chris, thank you for that. What's interesting is that 20 years ago -- we just celebrated our 20th anniversary -- there were all these powerful new vaccines that were being used in wealthy countries, and the challenge is, they weren't getting to the places that they could make the most difference: the developing world. So Gavi was formed as an alliance -- WHO, the World Bank, the Gates Foundation, UNICEF -- all working together to try to bring these vaccines to the developing world. And it's been very successful. We've launched 433 new vaccines in the most difficult countries in the world, in the Somalias and Yemens and DRCs and Nigerias. But we've also set up emergency stockpiles for outbreak-based vaccines, so if there's an outbreak anywhere in the world of yellow fever or of things like cholera or meningitis and now Ebola, we have vaccines that are available to do that. And the last thing we are trying to do is build the health systems out to deliver these vaccines, but also to make sure that we can pay attention to new diseases that pop up in different parts of the world. "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,03:43,CA: And just give us a sense of the scale of this. How many vaccines do you distribute in a given year? And how many lives do you believe that that may be saving? 
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,03:53,"SB: So, let me give you a macro number. We've immunized more than 760 million additional children -- 760 million additional children -- and prevented more than 13 million deaths. In an average year, we give about a half a billion doses because we started out with six diseases, but now we vaccinate against 18 different diseases. "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,04:20,"CA: Yeah, the scale of that is incredible, and amidst all the bad news that's happening, it's kind of amazing that this intervention can save so many lives. I mean, help us understand what a vaccine is. "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,04:36,"SB: So, the original idea, the word ""vaccine,"" comes from ""vaca,"" or cow. And the observation made in the 1700s was that milkmaids had beautiful skin, whereas everybody else had pockmarks from having gotten over smallpox. And the concept was that she was getting infected with a zoonosis, that is, with naturally occurring cowpox, not smallpox. That then protected against smallpox. And it was tested in those days: Could you artificially do that? They of course didn't understand virology, they didn't understand any of those issues. But what a vaccine is is something that you give to artificially stimulate the immune system, hopefully to not make you sick. But then later on, when the body comes in contact with the real disease, it thinks it's already seen it and it is able to fight it off without making the person sick. "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,05:30,"CA: I mean, it's kind of a miraculous thing to me that they work that way, that your body is always there looking for these threats. And a vaccine, I guess, the body perceives it as a threat, and therefore arms itself against that threat, right? And that's what gives the protection. So, is that why some people are sort of -- irrationally, I will say -- irrationally scared of vaccines and feel that they may be dangerous, because they are a kind of threat that you're putting into your body in a very subtle way? "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,06:03,"SB: Well, of course, when this first started, there were two ways to make vaccines. You could grind them up and inject them, so-called ""whole killed vaccines."" So you took organisms and you got an immune response, and sometimes those organisms, even though they were dead, gave you a pretty whopping immune response: your arms were sore, you got fevers. Then we moved to these weakened live viruses, and frankly, those are the best vaccines. That's what measles is. That's what yellow fever is. These are weakened viruses. They don't give you disease, but because they look like the natural viruses, your body gets protection and, frankly, you get protection for your whole life. Today, because people are worried about side effects, we've begun to use molecular biology and use little bits of it, and therefore, it's moved forward. But the reason people are mostly scared is because, frankly, vaccines have been so successful. You don't expect, if you have a child or two children, that those children are going to die of these diseases, unlike in the past, when three or four out of your five or six or seven kids would die. So today, people think, well, gee, these diseases aren't around, they're not that bad and, by the way, if I'm injecting these things, maybe they're not organic, maybe it'll make my child cry, maybe it'll make them sick, and I don't need to do it. And that's the challenge. You don't want to scare people to death on how bad these diseases can be, but at the same time, you want them to understand that these diseases are serious and can cause really bad disease and sequela. "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,07:36,"CA: So yesterday, you issued a really powerful call for this massive, coordinated global response to tackle the search for a coronavirus vaccine. We're going to come that in a bit, because I think that's a very exciting topic. But I think we need some more background first. I want to go back five years to when you stood on the TED stage and you held up two candidate Ebola vaccines. This was just a few months after Ebola had been terrifying the world. It was basically amazing how quickly those vaccines had been developed. What happened to them? "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,08:18,"SB: It's a great question, and let me tell a little bit of the story, but at the end, there were two vaccines. One, it turned out, couldn't finish its testing, because the epidemic died down. The other one was fully tested. It had a hundred percent efficacy. We then went on to work with manufacturers to produce that vaccine, at least temporarily, in an investigational form, just in case there were more outbreaks. There were, and those are the vaccine doses that we've used in the DRC. In the last two outbreaks, 280,000 people have been vaccinated with this experimental vaccine, and today, there is a licensed vaccine, and we are now procuring a global stockpile of a half a million doses. But let me just say, Chris, the reason they came so quickly at that moment is, after September 11th, there was concern in the US about bioterrorism. Remember, there were anthrax attacks. And so what happened was there was a list of agents, and Ebola, for a short time, was on that list of agents, so people started making vaccines, and later on, they decided that was not necessarily a good bioterrorism agent, so they dropped that off the list. But in the freezers were vaccines that had been started, and they were dusted off, and that's why we could move so quickly in that moment. "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,09:45,"CA: And yet, how long was it from that moment on the TED stage with the candidate vaccine to actual deployment? "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,09:53,"SB: So, what happened was, the epidemic began to go down. The clinical trial I told you about was done. It was a heroic clinical trial done by WHO, and it showed that it had these results. That epidemic then stopped. We didn't know if there were going to be more epidemics. It took another number of years to finish the work on the vaccine to make sure it was pure, to figure out how to manufacture it at scale. It's during that period that we put vaccine away and had it available in case there were other outbreaks. And it turned out, there were three outbreaks. One went away quickly, but there were two. I was there on day 13 of the second outbreak. We injected the vaccine, cases went up, then they went down, and controlled it. And then this DRC in North Kivu outbreak, which really was terrible because it was in a war zone. And that's the one where we've been not only vaccinating in DRC but in surrounding countries. By the way, that is now, I believe, day 38 or 39 out of the 42 necessary to say it's over. We hope it is. And that would be, again, an enormous example of what vaccines can do, even in a very difficult setting. "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,11:00,"CA: And yet, in one way, Seth, it's kind of shocking that the outbreak that happened at the start of 2015, end of 2014, that it happened at all, because the world has known about Ebola for a long time. It's been sequenced and so forth. A vaccine could have been developed and got ready for a possible outbreak. Why didn't that happen? "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,11:24,"SB: Well, there had been 26 outbreaks before, but each one of them was small -- couple of hundred people or a couple of dozen people -- in the poorest African countries in the world. There was no market for it. People didn't know how to test it because they would just pop up and then go away. And so even though it was obviously a disease that potentially could spread, it had never really spread before. Of course, in West Africa, they didn't have a good surveillance system; it spread for three months before people identified that it was Ebola, and by that time, it was too late. It had spread. What's important about that lesson is that then caused huge disruption across Africa, across the world, because cases went to other places. And the challenge then was, and the reason we had to step in, was because there still was no market. So the Gavi board said, ""We will put out 390 million dollars. We'll put it out there and tell companies, we're open for business, we'll create a market, we'll buy the vaccine."" And that led to companies being willing to finish the investment to get us to where we are today. "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,12:29,"CA: Right, right. So it's a real paradox, right? In a way, the very thing that makes vaccines so extraordinary, that once they're developed, they are so cheap to administer, for a few dollars, I guess, you can administer this dose that will save someone maybe a lifetime of illness or save their lives, and yet so much of medical research and invention and development is done by companies who need to see a revenue stream, and so they don't see it from those tiny little cheap things that might save a lot of lives. So it's a real market failure that in this circumstance now -- That's one of the things I guess you're thinking hard about, how on earth do we get round and avoid that market failure crippling the response this time? "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,13:14,"SB: Well, first of all, one of the reasons Bill Gates likes vaccines is, in a sense, it's a little bit like software creation. You put a lot of money and effort into creating it, but once you've got it, you can produce it pretty cheaply and use it in different places around the world. I don't want to beat up the pharmaceutical industry here because they were heroic in Ebola, but I think realistically, they are for-profit entities, and they have to say to their shareholders, ""Somebody's going to pay for this, or we're going to do it as a charitable thing."" And if we do it as a charitable thing, they can't keep doing it. Since then, there is a new initiative called CEPI, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations. It was set up at Davos a few years ago, and its purpose is to try to make vaccines for the list of diseases that aren't yet known epidemics but that can potentially be there. And the idea would be using public sector money to get us prepared. Of course, they jumped in on this coronavirus as well. Last thing is, of course, I'm not worried on a coronavirus stage that this is a problem, with not having a market. One of the challenges here is that there may be too big a market for this, and therefore, how do we make sure there's access for developing countries. "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,14:24,"CA: All right, so talk about this virus, Seth. How is it different from Ebola? How challenging is it to create a vaccine for it? "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,14:34,"SB: So what's interesting about coronaviruses is that they are animal viruses, probably primarily in bats. They jump into other animals sometimes, and then they jump into humans. So this shouldn't have been a surprise. This is the third coronavirus that has jumped into humans. We had SARS in early 2002, we had MERS a number of years later, and now we have this virus. What's interesting is there is a database that shows there are 30,000-some-odd isolated coronaviruses in animals, and one of the things that people tried to do was say the way these coronaviruses work is they have a spike on them. They're called ""corona"" because they look like the sun. That spike is where it attaches to a certain receptor in people's lungs. And so somebody said, well, maybe we can begin to look at those spikes and see if they're similar to the human receptors and they can be predicted. But the problem is people don't invest in those types of research. And, of course, I think that, given it's an evolutionary certainty, we're going to see this, that we should be. But one other point about this is coronavirus jumped into humans in ancient history as well, and so we have now about a third to a quarter of the common cold viruses are actually coronaviruses. And what's interesting about those is they don't make you deathly ill like these, but you also don't have long-term immunity to them, so you can get reinfected with these viruses after 10 months, a year. And so that does raise an issue on vaccinology, because you want to ideally have lifetime immunity. "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,16:07,"CA: The reason why we get reinfected is because the virus mutates slightly, and so it escapes the antibodies? "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,16:14,"SB: No, no, not in this case. Not in this case. So in flu, that's what happens. The viruses are always mutating. In HIV, the reason we don't have a vaccine is because they're all mutating. In this case, the immune response seems to get weaker and go away, and people get reinfected with the same viruses. Now, that is potentially a solvable problem using vaccinology and many different techniques, but the point is, we just can't assume. Some people now are talking about herd immunity as a way to deal with this virus, and the idea there is if you could get enough people infected -- you know, forget for a moment that a lot of people are going to die and be miserable while that happens -- but the idea is that you get a certain level immunity in the community, and then the disease will go away. Well, that is only true if you get long-term immunity. If you don't, then you could go through all of that horrible experience, have all those deaths, and then not have the protection you need to protect against this disease. "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,17:11,"CA: OK, so in a way, the quest we're looking for is a vaccine that will work for the long term. I mean, I guess any vaccine that works at all will be a huge gift, but it could well be one that we have to retake every year, or something like that. "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,17:26,"SB: Right. That is certainly possible. Of course, we have to remember, though, that SARS and MERS both had even higher mortality than this virus does, and they give a much more profound immune response. So it may be that they react differently than the common cold viruses. The challenge, of course, is that we haven't had the opportunity to study these over a long time, and this new disease -- three and a half months, we've had it. More science has been done for this disease in this short period of time, but we don't understand fully the epidemiology of the virus, the immune response, what's protective, which is the best animal model. All of that is being worked on by science and at breakneck pace, but a lot to learn. "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,18:09,"CA: So talk about how the medical and the research community responded. Because, the Chinese authorities -- I guess we heard it yesterday -- only found out about this sometime in December. Already, early in January -- I think the virus started in November, they found out about it in December -- by early January, they had already released a sequence of the virus to the world, and now here we are. And I think I saw that more than 40 companies are already claiming candidate vaccines. What does it mean to have a candidate vaccine? Like, have companies tested this already against animals or something? Or are they just looking at a computer model where they go, ""That should work""? "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,18:54,"SB: Well, it's an interesting question you ask there. So first of all, China was heroic on this. They did post the genetic sequence of it. Today, we have companies that can sit down with a computer and from that genetic sequence, make what is a candidate vaccine. Now, a candidate vaccine obviously means it's not a licensed product. It's something that somebody wants to work on. But you're right, you have to have the right nomenclature, because ""candidate"" can mean I'm working on something, it's in my head, I'm just doing a little work on it, I've got something in a vial, I'm beginning to do testing on it. And so what we saw in that case was a company called Moderna. That was the first vaccine that went into humans. It's a messenger RNA-based system. I actually visited the company, not in this outbreak but before, because the technology is interesting. And what they were able to do was, in 42 days, make a candidate vaccine from the genetic sequence. They didn't need the organism. That now is in clinical testing. Now, there is no licensed mRNA vaccine, so we're going to have to figure out, is it safe? Does it work in different age groups? How are we going to scale it up? All of that. But there are many others who are using conventional vaccinology. An example would be, the French are working on a measles-based vaccine. The idea is to put the spiked protein in the measles vector, and it takes a little bit longer to do that work, but once you have that done, of course, we know how to make measles vaccine. We make hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of millions of doses and provide it to the whole world. If that was to work, that might be easier to scale up. So I think what we want in the race is to have multiple different vaccines moving forward. We don't want one or two. We don't want a hundred in the late stages, because it's expensive and hard to do. But we want to have a diversity of science approaches going forward. "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,20:49,CA: Which of the other candidates out there are you excited by or at least intrigued by? 
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,20:55,"SB: Well, for me, the critical issue here is going to be we have to optimize for speed, and so that means, as I said, having examples of all the different new technologies that could potentially work, as well as conventional doses moving forward at the same time. So what you're going to want to do is have this bubble up. And it's not just companies, or big companies. It's also biotech companies. It's also academic researchers that are working on this. You want all of those to bubble up. Then you want to be able to look at what's the most promising, and that will depend upon animal results. It'll depend upon being able to produce those vaccines, have a pathway, and eventually, you will want to put those into human clinical trials. That requires a certain amount of safety work. You can try to accelerate that. But then you need to say, OK, we need to know, do we need one dose, do we need multiple doses, do we need 50 micrograms, 100, 150? Do we need a chemical stimulant we call an adjuvant? Given that this disease, its big problems in outcomes are in the elderly, we might need to put some stimulants in to make it a more potent immune response. So all of that work has to go on. That's what the clinical testing is. Eventually you say, ""Aha! Here's the vaccine we're going to use."" Now you test it in an efficacy trial. And that is to see, does it work? And at that point, you then have a vaccine that you know works. But there is a stage after that, and that stage is, you've got to work out the manufacturing, have it all worked out so that the regulators know that you can really make this, and that it's pure, it doesn't have any problems with it. And during that period, and that's what we did in Ebola, we were able to use those vaccines to help in outbreaks under a clinical trial protocol while monitoring them and learning. So there's a lot of steps there, and it's complicated, and I've shortened it a little bit. "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,22:52,"CA: But summarize the steps that they basically need to go through. I heard probably an animal test, and then -- "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,22:59,"SB: Well, for example, Moderna. They went into humans at the same time they're doing animal testing. We don't have a perfect animal model. But normally it takes 10 to 15 years to do this, and that's the compression you're trying to do here. So the challenge is, we can compress all those different clinical trials. The basic way you think about it is, preclinical studies, animals, understanding it, purity, reproducibility. Then you move into human studies. You start off with a small number of healthy people. You then work on the dosing, how much, how often. Then you move into people at risk for the disease -- that might be in this case the elderly or people with other conditions -- and then eventually do an efficacy trial. Now, one of the cool new things we can do today is something called ""adaptive trial design."" So rather than do these sequentially, what you can begin to do is enroll people and then, as you get the data you need, you can just begin to bring in the next set of groups, and by doing that, you can speed it up dramatically. "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,24:00,"CA: When you say enroll people, you mean enroll people who have their eyes wide open. They have informed consent. I think that's the term. "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,24:08,SB: Absolutely. 
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,24:10,"CA: And they're willing to, I guess, take the risk that this isn't a fully tested vaccine but it may well be efficacious, and so that obviously can help a lot. That's crucial to this, right? "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,24:25,"SB: Absolutely. They are the unsung heroes of vaccinology, because people go out, they volunteer to take a substance, particularly early on, that don't know how it's going to react. Is it going to make the disease worse? Make it better? Is it going to protect them? Is it going to make them sick? So you try to predict that if you can with animals, but people do do that, and the informed consent says not only you may have these side effects or these problems, but also this vaccine may not work. And so it's important for people to understand that, because you don't want people to go and put themselves at high risk, saying, ""Oh, gee, I had a vaccine, and so I'm protected."" We don't know that until we get to the efficacy stage of trials. "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,25:04,"CA: But Seth, even putting together all those dots, what I've heard most people say is that it is likely to take at least 18 months before the world will have a vaccine available at any kind of scale. Is that time line right? And can the world remotely afford 18 months on this? "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,25:25,"SB: Well, I think, you know, I've given you many questions. I could raise lots more questions. So part of it's going to be luck: How easy is this particular candidate vaccine going to be? How lucky will we be in getting a good immune response? Which approaches will work? Will they be scalable? So I think there's lot of questions there. The world will do everything they can to squeeze it down, but I think that's the time line we're talking about. And remember, it's 10 to 15 years usually. In the case of Ebola, we did it in five years to a licensed product. In this case, we are hoping to squeeze it down dramatically, but there are many things we're going to have to go through, and it's really about making sure that vaccine works and it is safe for use in what ultimately may be billions of people. "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,26:14,CA: Whitney. 
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,26:16,"WPR: Hi. So we have lots of questions coming in, Seth. One of them that's kind of related to this is, you know, a lot of us right now are isolating, and we're not building our exposure to this virus, so how will that affect us in the long term? Will this make us vulnerable to the virus until a vaccine is available? "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,26:35,"SB: So that's a great question, and, as you know, we don't fully understand the epidemiology of this virus, but there is some sense that there may be asymptomatics. Do they get immune protection? Are they afterwards resistant to infection? We don't know that, but we do know that people do get sick, including young people, and that sickness can be quite severe. Obviously, a lot of it is mild, but some of it is quite severe, and then it gets more severe in the elderly. So I wouldn't recommend that anybody go out and intentionally try to get exposed to this virus now. The whole idea of having isolation now is to try to stop the chains of transmission, protect health workers in hospitals, with the idea being that if you can suppress it enough -- and Bill talked about this in his talk -- and later on have testing available, you might be able to go back to somewhat of a normal life and then watch for reintroduction of this virus. Of course, at the end of the day, we will probably need a vaccine to be able to completely control that, but the experiment is going on, in China ... Japan has done an amazing job of controlling this with slightly less severe interventions. We've seen in Korea similar things. So the hope would be that if we take it seriously, we actually damp down the exposures and stop this epidemic now, we'll be able to remove to some form of normalcy. And we also may have drugs, and drugs will change the dynamics as well, because people will then know that they are able to get treatment as well. "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,28:10,WPR: Great. I'll be back later with other questions I'm seeing. 
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,28:13,"SB: Thanks, Whitney. "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,28:14,"CA: Thanks, Whitney. Thanks everyone watching. Keep those questions coming. Seth, this time line, I've been puzzled about this, because I get that there are so many things that have to be checked out, but I still worry that the rules are not adapting rapidly enough for the scale of the emergency. I mean, my analogy would be: you're going about your lives, and suddenly there's this emergency, you see that there's this enemy force approaching you from the horizon and coming your direction. You don't, in that circumstance, spend a week trying to test all your guns and make sure they're operating absolutely safely and in the right way. You galvanize and you do take some additional risk for the sake of avoiding the bigger risk. Is that thinking prevalent right now? Are there people trying to make those kinds of trade-offs? How should we think about that? Or do you really believe that the community is galvanizing and moving forward as fast as it humanly can and appropriately balancing the two risks? "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,29:23,"SB: I think we're seeing heroics in moving forward here. Obviously, you're right, and the reason we talk about going from 10 to 15 years down to something like 18 months is about squeezing those steps as much as possible. The regulators in the Ebola experience were really fabulous. They worked with us and tried to keep any bureaucratic delays down to the smallest amount possible. And I think that's what's going to be important here, is we have to look at every single step and say, ""Is it critical?"" But you do need to answer a lot of these questions. For example, if you have a vaccine that works in healthy people, it very well may not give an immune response to the elderly. We may need to change that vaccine to make it work there. It may not work in young children. So you need a certain amount of studies done. Of course, if you work in areas that have big outbreaks, you're able to also enroll more quickly and follow people more quickly. That's one of the reasons we'll have to think about this globally, because we don't know in 12 to 18 months, or even six to 18 months, if we're really lucky, where the epidemic will be raging and where we want to do the clinical trials. We should be prepared to do them wherever in the world it's possible, and also do some in different types of countries. Developing countries may have different immune responses than in wealthy countries. "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,30:44,"CA: What alarms me a bit is that on the models I've looked at, with the possible exception of what happened in China and Japan, by distancing, we can bend the curve, we can reduce infection. But as soon as you go back to normal, there's this huge risk of a massive resurge, and until the vaccine comes along, it feels like your choices are: one, sort of recklessly expose the whole population to the bug and develop some kind of herd immunity, or try and do this scary dance of really cramping down on the economy and all the risks that are associated with that, and risking, if you lift the lid on that, risking these really dangerous second surges. So is that the right way to think about it? There's a scenario where, until this happens, and if it's 18 months, that's an incredibly long time for the world to be in that sort of dangerous, scary dance. "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,31:47,"SB: Well, I think the issue here is that is a little bit the way to think of it, but the experiment is going on now. China is now releasing its controls, and we will see what happens there. We'll see where they have to clamp back down and what's going to happen, and we'll get a good idea of what that's like. Right now, in many countries, we're still in the upscale period when we're seeing lots of cases. And so we have to break that transmission first before we can have that conversation. I'm the first person that would like a vaccine to occur quicker, and, of course, my job is to underpromise and overdeliver, not the other way around. And I think we have to be careful not to think about, ""Oh, we can just have a vaccine in a couple of months."" It may be that we're lucky. It may be that it's easy to do. It may be the first few candidates will show promise, we get efficacy, we can scale those up for at least some limited use while it's being worked out. But a lot of things have to fall in place for that to happen. And that's why we want to have an organized, global effort to absolutely incentivize the best possible chance for that to happen in the fastest way. "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,32:56,"CA: There's some kind of debate out there about whether there might be way, way more cases, mild cases, basically zero-symptom cases of coronavirus out there that may have granted more people immunity than we know. Is that a credible suggestion? More cases and much lower fatality rate than we know, because so many of the cases could be invisible? "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,33:20,"SB: You know, Mayor Bloomberg used to have a saying that I loved. He said, ""In God we trust. Everybody else, bring data."" And I think the answer here is we haven't done enough testing to know, and we started out with PCR tests to look for virus, and therefore, if you had recovered, didn't have the virus anymore, we weren't able to pick it up. Now there are beginning to be antibody tests to look to see if you've been exposed and don't have the virus now but have an immune response to it. Once we have those tests operating at scale, we'll be able to understand what the epidemiology is and what's happening, and then we'll be in a much better place to understand how this is playing out. Also, I mean, even the question: We don't see a lot of cases in children -- is that because the children get infected but they don't get symptoms, and therefore they might be potential spreaders? Or, is it because those children don't get it at all? "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,34:11,"CA: So tell us, Seth, about this call that you issued yesterday. I mean, you've said that scientists are behaving heroically. But you've called for something more here from both scientists, companies, governments. Tell us what your call is. "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,34:29,"SB: So, first of all, I believe that, given the situation here, this is not the time to just let the normal system work, as we've talked about. I think we have to think about vaccines as a global public good. And what that means is that initially, it ought to be public sector financed. Obviously, if others want to contribute resources, I believe they should, fine. But we want to make sure the best approaches come, and it doesn't matter where they come from in the world. We want to make sure if the best approach is in China or Japan or in South Korea or in the US, wherever it comes from, whatever company has the ideas, get them on the table. Then we want a process to say, realistically, how are these being compared? How do we decide which ones are most likely to succeed? And then, as I explained, some diversity in taking those risks. Maybe some new technology, some old technologies to drive forward. Once that happens, then, to try to get clinical trials to drive forward as quickly as possible. Now, the delay here is actually likely to be in manufacturing, because we might want billions and billions of doses, so how do we then begin to invest, at risk, in manufacturing plants? If it's a big company, they may have adequate manufacturing, but we may want to work with contract manufacturers, other companies, or even build plants or use new technologies, modular technologies to do this. And then, of course, at the end is going to be the process of getting the vaccine out to all those who need it, and that's going to need to be dependent upon the risk at that time. "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,36:04,"CA: Help me understand this better, Seth, because right now, it feels like there's this huge effort going on, but companies are operating, in a way, competitively with each other. To an extent, countries are operating competitively with each other. Are you saying that what the world needs is some kind of widely supported global -- I don't know -- vaccine czar that is pulling together different efforts, coordinating, encouraging everyone to work together for the common good, and trying to get agreement on these big decisions like what are the smart few candidates to get behind, rather than this confusing explosion? And then, how do we coordinate manufacturing, etc? Like, is that a person or a small organization that some combination of governments, WHO, UN needs to put together? "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,36:54,"SB: So, first of all, you want science to bubble up at the beginning. You don't want to have centralized control, somebody saying, ""I know best and I'm going to predict this."" So you want it bubbling up from all over the place, but then you want a coordinated effort. The group that is best-placed to do that is the World Health Organization, maintaining a list of all the different programs that are going on. We also have other organizations. I mentioned CEPI before. CEPI has now supported eight different candidates. I think it's going to support more. Right now, WHO has on its list 44 candidates, but some people think as many as double that. So what you want to do is say, which are the most likely to succeed, and then put them through some type of standardized set of criteria to pick a few of them to move forward aggressively for the world. Obviously, science is going to keep moving, they're going to keep changing, and it may be that your original approach isn't right and new ideas may come up, but you do need to have some process of moving this forward. And really, that's what I called for. What we need to make sure is that if companies have adequate resources to do this on their own, that's fine, but if not, they need to be supported by the public sector and, again, making sure there's adequate manufacturing and ultimately distribution. Then, after a period of time, we can go back to normal and return to the normal way vaccines are handled. But I think that's probably the best way to get there. "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,38:22,"CA: How much might this cost, and who should pay for it? "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,38:27,"SB: Well, it depends how many cases there are. The good news is, we're talking now about trillions of dollars in economic loss, and this is going to be -- "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,38:37,CA: I would hardly call that good news. 
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,38:39,"SB: I mean, I'm making the comparison. Sorry, you're absolutely right, Chris. I mean, we're talking about tens of billions of dollars here, not trillions of dollars, and the reason that's important is you want to make sure that any good idea has its best chance of moving forward, and we ought to, again, optimize for speed and not optimize for being cost-effective at this time. "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,39:03,"CA: So I guess you're saying that, like, the rich countries may well be able to afford some kind of vaccine program. I think what I hear you doing here is representing a lot of the countries that can't afford it, and what you're saying is that the world may have to find a way of spending tens of billions of dollars to avoid trillions of dollars of economic damage and all the hardship that goes with it around the world. Is that about right? "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,39:28,"SB: That's absolutely right, but I think the important point is, this needs to be a global perspective. I mean, look at what happened with Ebola. We had a vaccine that was originally made in Canada by the Public [Health] Agency of Canada. It was then transferred to a US biotech, then to Merck and Company, which is obviously a global player based in the US, and they're manufacturing it in Germany. That's the way science works, and these vaccines may need components from other places. So how do we think about this in a global way and make sure that -- By the way, the second vaccine that's in humans is from China. Of course, they've had a lot of time to work on it compared to some others. And they have a candidate that's moving forward. If that candidate is successful, we want to make sure that's the one that's scaled up. And so for me, it's making sure that we're looking at this as a global ecosystem with the best candidates moving forward for the good of the world. "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,40:20,CA: Whitney. 
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,40:22,"WPR: We have a lot of people watching from all over the world and we're seeing questions, especially from some of our friends in India who are watching, connected to this just basically about how are poor nations going to get access to this vaccine? And then, specifically, when we think about who gets the vaccine first, will there be some sort of payment that people are paying for this vaccine and those who can afford it will get access before others? "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,40:47,"SB: Well, the decision on who will pay for it will ultimately come from the political leaders, and my recommendation would be, you start off as a global public good, you make the vaccine available because we're trying to stop the epidemic. Later on, we can have tiered pricing in different places. But one of the concerns, of course, is: Where is the epidemic going to be at that point, and who needs it first? I would argue that people that will need it first are probably health workers, because health workers are going to be on the front lines and we want them to be there to be able to take care of people. They're at risk of both contracting it as well as spreading it. Then you probably want to think about the high-risk individuals, the elderly, people who have preexisting conditions, and then eventually, the rest of the population, if it's needed. So having some type of way of thinking about that. We'll also need to be thinking about equitable access, and that is going to mean thinking about the entire world. Now, Gavi, in the past, including in India, has worked to make sure these new technologies are there, but these are vaccines that existed and, in this case, it's a new vaccine. We have to make sure that it isn't hoarded only in wealthy countries or in a select set of countries. And one way to do that would be to have vaccine production in multiple places. So today a lot of the vaccines that Gavi uses are made around the world. Some are made in the United States and Europe, but some are made in South Korea, in India, in China, in other countries. And so what we could do is have a vaccine transfer the technology and manufacturing in multiple different sites so we could have enough vaccine for that original launch. But whatever happens, there will always be a period of time when we'll have an exciting vaccine and not enough doses to go around, and that's when we need to take hard decisions based upon science on who should get it. "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,42:36,"WPR: Thanks for that, Seth. I'll be back later with other questions. "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,42:39,"CA: Thanks, Whitney. SB: Thank you. "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,42:41,"CA: How confident are you that we'll eventually get one? I mean, we still don't have a vaccine for HIV, nor for the common cold. How can you be confident that we can get one this time? "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,42:53,"SB: Well, first of all, as you know, I did a TED Talk even before the one of 2015 talking about HIV and flu and how new science needs to come in, and frankly, we are making progress against some of these incredibly difficult organisms. You talked about variability. That's the problem with HIV. It's constantly changing, and so you're chasing. You get a good immune response, but it's to the strain that was there before, and now you're chasing new strains. There are ways to work around that. It's new science. I, actually, I am optimistic. I'm optimistic because we have some experience with SARS vaccines and with MERS vaccines, and so people have worked on it. They've been able to get good immune responses in animals and in people for those vaccines. And so we can build on that experience. I can't tell you how long they'll last for, how effective they will be. Will they need to have local mucosal immunity, which is in the mouth and nose, as well as serum immunity in the bloodstream? Will they need to have just antibodies or the other arm of the immune system, the cellular arm? These are questions that will need to be answered, but I am a great believer in the power of science, and I think in this case the organism is not going to be quite as difficult as the ones you're talking about that are much more difficult. "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,44:12,"CA: You mentioned in your TED Talk five years ago, Seth, that we've got this situation where we're spending billions of dollars on nuclear submarines patrolling the oceans for a possible incoming threat, nuclear war threat or whatever, and almost nothing on preparation for a pandemic like the one we're suffering. If the world is adequately shaken up by what's happening now and gets rational about this, what is the key structural shift that would be the pandemic equivalent of having those nuclear submarines? How do we prepare for a new virus that we don't know what it will be or when it will come? How do we prepare to have a much more rapid response? "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,45:01,"SB: Well, it's a great question and I think the TED community has a role to play here. So first of all, we need better surveillance. We need surveillance everywhere in the world, and that's why we don't want to have another outbreak like in West Africa with Ebola. You want to have a resilient health system in every country that reaches out to the periphery. And that's an important priority. We're doing pretty good with immunization. We've reached 90 percent of the kids of the world with at least one dose of routine vaccine. That's the best of health interventions. But we need to reach that last 10 percent and put that health system in place. Then we need to have a different view. We need to start working, where are our likely hot spots? It's where we're cutting down forest. It's in urban slums, where there's density of populations. It's with climate change and movement of different vectors. And what we need to do is use predictive science, and that's where big data can help, that's where AI can help in terms of trying to do that. And we need to have a one-health approach, because we tend to think of animal diseases -- and by the way, people have worked on coronavirus vaccines for animals, because they also cause disease there -- we need to make sure that the scientists working on veterinary vaccines are connected to humans, are thinking about those whole ecosystem. And we need to invest in that. And unfortunately, after an epidemic, everybody wants to invest, and they say, ""Whatever it takes,"" and then we move to on other things, and investments go down. What's different about the military is that there is a baseline of investment that goes on all the time and nobody questions that. It continues, and that level of preparedness seems to be there. Bill Gates in his talk in TED, when we did that back-to-back, said, look, the military are doing war games, they're constantly testing, they have all this preparatory activities. Why are we not doing that in diseases? And, as you know, since then, there has been some war games, and they've basically said we weren't prepared, and I think we're seeing now that, in fact, we're not as prepared as we could be. So my hope, the silver lining would be that we prepare for the next big outbreak, because it's absolutely evolutionarily certain we will continue to have outbreaks. The question is: How prepared are we to deal with those? "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,47:14,"CA: As we wait for a vaccine, are there other interventions that could be made, for example, the serum from people who have been infected and have recovered? "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,47:27,"SB: So, that technique has been used in other infectious diseases and throughout history and even in Ebola recently. That's something that could potentially be done. Of course, today, it's more attractive if you can make antibodies in the laboratory and then have those available at scale and use those, and I know of a lot of companies that are working on producing those antibodies, which could be infused in an emergency situation, and do that. Obviously, drugs may play an important role here. There's a similar effort to try to create drugs that are active against this organism, and if we knew that you'd get sick but there was an effective treatment, that would also change a little bit of the dynamics of the fear that exists around this pandemic. So I think there are lots of interventions. Of course, traditionally, a preventive vaccine is the best way to deal with these types of epidemics. "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,48:21,"CA: So paint us -- it's the inner optimist in me, begging for something -- paint us the best case scenario, Seth. Lots of people are saying, we don't want to be huddled in our homes by ourselves for 18 months, lovely though the internet is. What's the best case scenario, putting all the pieces together here? "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,48:44,"SB: Well, I think what is likely to happen, but I don't want to predict, because we're in unprecedented times here. What's likely to happen is that countries who don't take this seriously will have severe outbreaks, those that really take it seriously and put these extraordinary mechanisms in place will control the disease. It'll take some time, it'll take -- you know, this is weeks, maybe months, not years, to do that. And then you end up with a situation where the disease is controlled, and you then can go back to life as normal with some cautions around it. Now there's beginning to be new tests that are going to be home tests. We're going to be able to figure out whether classrooms, regions, countries have disease. We can go back to some level of normalcy, but one thing that's really important is we can't have areas of the world with raging disease. So for example, if people said, ""Oh, we're not worried about Africa, we're only worried about our countries,"" you might end up in a situation where you have large numbers of infections, the virus is mutating, it's actually adapting to humans. We saw some of that with SARS. And then it is easy to reintroduce. So what you want to do is dampen it down everywhere in the world. And maybe it'll burn out. Maybe that'll be it. I personally think we'll probably need a vaccine, but best case scenario is that those alone will stop the epidemic, and what we'll need is then a vaccine just in case it comes back, but of course if I was a betting man, I'd say let's get a vaccine as soon as possible, because that's the best way to control a viral infection, particularly one that is spread respiratorily. "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,50:22,"CA: Yeah. It's so interesting what you said there. Like, the vaccine doesn't know what continent it's on, what country it's in. It just does its thing. "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,50:31,SB: That's correct. 
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,50:34,"CA: So in terms of people listening here, what kind of psychological advice can you give them? What should expectations be? Like, do we have to be ready to settle in for the long haul here, or should we be looking forward to getting back to business around about Easter time and celebrating? "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,50:52,"SB: Well, again, I don't want to put a time line on it like others do. What you're going to want to see is that bending of the curve. I think Bill talked about this. You want the reproductive rate below one. You want to get it way below one if you can, and then to begin to see the disease spread. And what you don't want to do is, in the middle of that, jump out and start having parties. It's not time to go on spring break and start mixing again. But with careful control, you can begin to release the controls if that's what science shows us. And I think the most important thing here is we need the data to tell us that. That's why testing is so important. With the wide availability of testing, we'll be able to keep tabs, know what's happening. We'll know how many people are asymptomatic, what's happened. We'll know where there are hot communities, and we'll be able to deal with this, is my prediction. So I don't think this is over a very, very long time, but I wouldn't rush it during this unprecedented moment. Otherwise, we're going to end up seeing what we saw in Italy. What we're seeing in New York right now is the overwhelming of the health system. "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,51:58,"CA: Yeah, no kidding. New York is a scary place right now. I was out walking today. I hope that was OK. But there was no one. There was no one. Like, you couldn't get within six feet of someone if you tried right now, on the busiest walk spots. That was nice to see, but man, it's startling. "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,52:21,"SB: I mean, recent data has shown that droplets can spread the disease, and so people are rightfully being cautious. And we didn't know that. You remember when we started, we said it's a point outbreak, out of Wuhan, wet market, you had to be in the market to get the disease. Then it was, if you were with sick people, you got the disease. Then it was maybe asymptomatics. I think as we understand better, that gives us the tools to do the right thing. "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,52:46,"CA: There's a debate out there that seems to be growing again about masks. The East and West take very different advice on masks. We were hearing from Gary Liu yesterday that everyone in Hong Kong and China is basically wearing masks, and arguably, that has been effective. The advice in the West against not wearing masks -- how much of that has been driven by just the fact that there's a shortage of masks and that if anyone needs to wear them, it's medical professionals? If it's water droplets, it seems like masks could be effective in prevention. "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,53:21,"SB: I mean, the most important intervention, as you know, is some isolation and very careful handwashing or use of sanitizers, because what happens is, you touch your face -- I forget the number, I think it's like every one to two minutes -- and you touch your eyes, so if you reach a door handle or you have contact with a surface, and we know the virus can live on those surfaces, and then you touch your face, touch your mouth, touch your nose, you can spread it. So the purpose of a mask for a person who is not infected is not so much to keep them from getting infected. It is to keep them from touching their face. So I think what's interesting here is, how do we get people to have this personal sanitation? If we have unlimited quantities of masks, people want to do it as a way to remind themselves not to touch their face. Now, that's very different if you're infected, because if you're coughing, having a mask on does reduce the spread of droplets, and that's why they recommend it in a situation where somebody is infected and has to go to the hospital or has to go out and be seen. "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,54:30,"CA: Yeah, I was touching my face all through the Bill Gates interview, apparently, and I got called to task by our online friends, which was very nice. I don't know if I've been doing that today. It's funny, you're unconscious of it. It's weird. "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,54:43,"SB: Yes. No, it's automatic. And in fact, there was a WHO challenge for safe handwashing, and I did a video, and I left my water running while I did it, and my friends in the developing world came to me and said, you know, I live in Switzerland by a lake where we have a lot of water, and I wasn't careful, and they were absolutely right. So it's really good we correct each other, that's an important point, and help each other in doing this to get us to be as compliant as we possibly can for these issues. Whitney. "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,55:16,"WPR: Yep. So feedback online is overwhelmingly positive. You're really answering all of everyone's questions out there, and people really appreciate what you're sharing, Seth. I think one big question is just for folks who are watching from home and maybe who are not part of your community in terms of the science community. How can they contribute to this global response effort? How can they do something to advance this? "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,55:40,"SB: That's a great question. So first of all, I think it's really important that citizens support leaders who are following science, are using science, because, as you know, sometimes political leaders say, ""Well, I don't want to do this because it's not good for my image or it's not good for the economy or it's not good for whatever."" And I think you want to have all of your decisions taken by science, understanding that they're not the best science. So, citizens need to applaud, even if it's a tough decision that politicians take for the good based upon science, that's a good thing. The second thing that really would be helpful is this concept: How do we keep our world focused on the fact that these epidemics will occur? Another example I didn't answer, which Chris, when he asked me about what could be done, we talked about this idea of platform technologies. These are vaccines that you can test, get them all ready, and then, when a new organism occurs, you can put it in there and you know how to manufacture it, how to scale it up. These types of things can be done. CEPI is trying to do that now. But the challenge is, if we, a year after this, go down to having no money available for these types of issues, that will be a problem. So what you need is citizens to say, ""I understand now that health is precious, and I want my government, my leaders to invest in this, in the science, in the ways of working so that we will be as safe as we can be going forward."" And I think I can't emphasize enough how important a message that is for citizens everywhere in the world. "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,57:14,"CA: Mmm. Hey Whitney, stay on as we wrap up here. I guess what I'd like to give you a chance to do, Seth, as we wrap this up is just to look at the camera and make your call to the world's leaders, companies, politicians, scientists, citizens. How do we move forward? How would you wrap this up? "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,57:45,"SB: So from my perspective, what we need is the world to come together at this moment, not to talk about our national programs, not to talk about our science are the best, and they may be the best, but how do we, as a world, pool our best science, our best resources, our best ways of working, our best manufacturing, our best clinical trials, to move this forward as fast as possible? The WHO is a global organization whose job is this normative function, and we can get scientists to help them make sure that the normative function is as strong as it can be. We can get the leaders of the world to come together and put the resources in place. Given the cost it's having on the economy, this will be a real bargain to invest in it. But what we need is to have that mindset of having science drive us and to make sure that we have no barriers in stopping that science going forward. That's my request to the world, and I think we can do it, and if we do that, we will end up seeing the power of science, which will give us the tools we need to either stop it -- hopefully, it'll be stopped by then -- but stop it and then prepare us for the next one. "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,58:56,"CA: Mmm. Powerfully said. I have to say, Seth, it's incredibly encouraging to know that there are people like you out there in the trenches, trying to coordinate this immense and crucial effort on behalf of all of us, and also that there's an organization out there, that your organization is tasked to carry any effective vaccine to the many billions of people who may live in countries that can't afford to pay the same prices that the West can pay. That's really cool that you're doing that, and thank you so much for explaining so clearly to us what the situation is. I guess I speak for the majority of people listening to say all power to you with pulling these threads together. Thank you, Seth. "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,59:49,"WPR: Thank you, Seth. "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,59:50,"SB: Thank you, Chris and Whitney and the TED community for all of your support over the years. Let's continue to use science and technology for the good of the world to solve problems like this. "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,1:00:02,"CA: Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant. "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,1:00:04,"WPR: That was wonderful. I learned so much from this conversation. It seems like everyone online also really did, which was helpful. And I'd like to remind everyone that, if you missed part of this interview, you can watch it on our Facebook page as soon as we finish, and then also -- and I'm going to read the link -- it's go.ted.com/tedconnects. So our Facebook page, or go.ted.com/tedconnects. "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,1:00:32,"CA: Thanks so much for joining us. We get the sense people, literally all over the world and in so many different circumstances, and yet, this moment has given us a new excuse to bring you all together. Part of me, even though you really could wish that we weren't in this situation, it does give us a chance to explore some ideas in greater depth than we're normally able to, to have these conversations. These are not 15-minute talks on a red circle. You can just go a little bit deeper, and there's something really cool about that that I think we want to do more of, and we want to figure out how to hear from you and include you and make sure that your questions and your thoughts are coming in. As we speak, we're dreaming up what speakers to bring next. We know about Friday. We don't necessarily know beyond that. But watch this space. Whitney, talk about what's going to happen tomorrow. "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,1:01:37,"WPR: So we're really excited. We're going to have Priya Parker on to finish out the week for us. She is the author of ""The Art of Gathering,"" and she's going to give us some really helpful tips, I think, about how we can stay connected during this time, which is something I'm sure all of us are struggling with as we're trying to practice social distancing and are just spending more time physically apart. So going into the weekend, that feels like the type of thing I think all of us can really benefit from hearing. "
f5ae6143fa79ba55deb5e9e720b4c681,1:02:03,"CA: If you've got value from this conversation, consider sharing it, sharing those links with people you know. That would be cool. And hang in there, everyone. These are hard days. We know many people are struggling hugely. Hang in there. We'll get through it together somehow. And until tomorrow, take care. Bye for now. "

0cdccbb0c544e4909e1b4716f52f2280,00:04,"I guess all of you have a smartphone or an iPhone, and this morning, probably you checked on the weather, if its going to be rainy to carry your umbrella, if it is going to be sunny to use your sunglasses, or if it is going to be cold to have an extra coat. It's going to give you, sometime, good information and sometime not. Let me tell you, my best app is my grandmother. "
0cdccbb0c544e4909e1b4716f52f2280,00:40,"She's called Mamadda. She can tell you not only today's weather but she can predict the next 12 months, if it's going to be a good rain season or not. She can tell you just by observing her environment, by observing the wind direction, the cloud position, the bird migration, the size of fruits, the plant flowers. She can tell you by observing the behavior of her own cattle. That's how she knows better the weather and the ecosystem that she's living in. "
0cdccbb0c544e4909e1b4716f52f2280,01:22,"I'm coming from a pastoralist community who are cattle herders. We are nomadic. We move from one place to another one to find water and pasture. We can move up to a thousand kilometers, the size of California, within one year. And this life helps us to live in harmony with our ecosystem. We understand each other. For us, the nature is our supermarket, where we can collect our food, our water. It's our pharmacy where we can collect our medicinal plants. But it's our school, where we can learn better how to protect it and how it can give us back what we need. "
0cdccbb0c544e4909e1b4716f52f2280,02:13,"But with the climate change impact, we are experiencing a different impact. In my community, we have one of the top five fresh waters in Africa. It's Lake Chad. When my mother was born, Lake Chad used to be about 25,000 kilometers square of water. When I was born, 30 years ago, it was 10,000 kilometers square. And actually now, it's about 1,200 kilometers square of water. Ninety percent of this water just evaporated, disappeared. And you have more than 40 million people living around this lake and depending on it. They are pastoralists. They are fishermen. And they are farmers. They do not depend on the end of the month's salary. They depend on the rainfall. They depend on the crops that are growing or the pasture for their cattle. The shrinking resources, you have many communities that are fighting to get access. The first come is the first served. The second have to fight unto death. "
0cdccbb0c544e4909e1b4716f52f2280,03:46,"So climate change is impacting our environment by changing our social life, because the role of man and woman in this region, it's different. Man is supposed to feed his family, take care of his community, and if he cannot do that, his dignity is under threat. He cannot do anything else to pay it back. So climate change takes our men far away from us. That is the migration. They can migrate to a big city where they can stay for six or 12 months, where they get a job, they can send back money. If they didn't get it, they have to jump into the Mediterranean and migrate to Europe. Some of them die there, but none of them stop going. "
0cdccbb0c544e4909e1b4716f52f2280,04:54,"Of course, it's sad for the hosting country, who are developed countries, who have to adapt to host the migrants coming. But how about those who are left behind, the women and the children who have to play the role of men, the role of women, who have to take care of the security, of the food, of the health of the entire family, children and old people? So those women for me, they are my heroes, because they are innovators, they are solution makers, they are changing the little of the resources into the big for the community. So those are my people. "
0cdccbb0c544e4909e1b4716f52f2280,05:43,"So we use our indigenous people's traditional knowledge to get better resilience to what we need to survive. Our knowledge is not only for our communities. It's to share with each and others who are living with us. And indigenous peoples around the world are saving 80 percent of the world's biodiversity. That's the scientists who say that. Indigenous peoples in the Amazon, you can find the most diverse ecosystem, better than the national park. The indigenous peoples from the Pacific, the grandma and the grandpa, they know where to get food after the hurricane hits them. So the knowledge that our peoples know is helping us to survive and helping other peoples also to survive the climate change impact. The world is losing. We lost already 60 percent of the species, and it's increasing every day. "
0cdccbb0c544e4909e1b4716f52f2280,07:00,"So one day, I took a scientist to my community. I said, you are giving the good weather information through the TV and radio, but how about coming to my people? And then they come, they sit around, and suddenly, as we are nomadic, we just start packing our stuff, and then they say, like, ""Are we moving?"" I'm like, ""No, we are not moving. It's going to rain."" And they're like, ""Oh, there's no cloud. How do you know it's going to rain?"" We're like, ""Yeah, it's going to rain."" We pack our stuff. Suddenly, heavy rain starts coming, and we are seeing the scientist running around, hiding under trees and protecting their stuff. We already packed ours. "
0cdccbb0c544e4909e1b4716f52f2280,07:50,"After the end of the rain, the serious discussion starts. They say, ""How do you know that it's going to rain?"" We say, ""Well, the old woman observed the insects taking the eggs inside their homes, and while the insect cannot talk or watch TV, they know how to predict to protect their generations, how to protect their food. So for us it's the sign that it's going to rain in at maximum a couple of hours."" And then they say, well, we do have knowledge, but we do not combine ecological knowledge and weather knowledge all together. So that's how I started working with meteorological scientists and my communities to give better information to get peoples adapted to climate change. "
0cdccbb0c544e4909e1b4716f52f2280,08:48,"I think, if we put together all the knowledge systems that we have -- science, technology, traditional knowledge -- we can give the best of us to protect our peoples, to protect our planet, to restore the ecosystem that we are losing. "
0cdccbb0c544e4909e1b4716f52f2280,09:10,"I did that in another way, also. I used a tool that I really love a lot. It's called a 3D participatory mapping: participatory, because it can bring women, men, youth, elders, all the intergenerational peoples. Then they use science-based knowledge, and the community comes together, they build this map, they figure out all the knowledge that we have about where is our sacred forest, where is our water point, where is our corridor, where is the place that we move during each season. And these tools are amazing, because it's building capacity of women, because in our communities women and men cannot sit together. Men talk always, women just sitting there, but in the back. They are not there to take any decision. So after the men figure out all the knowledge, we say, well, you call the women, ""Come and have a look."" They say, ""Yes, sure,"" because they've already done the first work. "
0cdccbb0c544e4909e1b4716f52f2280,10:21,"When the women come, and they look at the map, they're like, ""Mm, no."" "
0cdccbb0c544e4909e1b4716f52f2280,10:27,"""This is wrong. Here's where I collect the medicine. Here's where I collect the food. Here's where I collect --"" So we changed the knowledge in the map, and we called the men. Well, they think about what women said. All of them shaking their heads. ""They are right. They are right. They are right."" So that's how we build the capacity of the women in giving them a voice in this 3D participatory mapping, so women get the detailed knowledge that can help the community to adapt. And man have the bigger picture knowledge. So when we put it together, this map helps them to discuss but to mitigate the conflict between the communities to access the resources, to share better these resources, to restore it and to manage it for the long term. "
0cdccbb0c544e4909e1b4716f52f2280,11:23,"Our knowledge is very useful. Indigenous peoples' knowledge are very crucial for our planet. It's crucial for all the peoples. Science knowledge was discovered 200 years ago, technology 100 years ago, but indigenous peoples' knowledge, it's thousands of years ago. So why we cannot put all of these together, combine those three knowledges and give the better resilience to the peoples who are getting the impact of climate change? And now it's not only the developing countries. It's the developed countries also. We saw the hurricane. We saw the flood around all the places. We saw the fire, even here in California. So we need all this knowledge to come together. We need the people in the center. And we need the decision makers to change, scientists tell them, and we tell them, and we do have this knowledge. "
0cdccbb0c544e4909e1b4716f52f2280,12:31,"We have 10 years to change it. Ten years is nothing, so we need to act all together and we need to act right now. "
